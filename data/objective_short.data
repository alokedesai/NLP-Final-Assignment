WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a legal challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law which , if successful , would deprive millions of Americans of tax-credit subsidies to help them afford health insurance coverage .In a one-sentence order , the court said it would take up a case brought by conservative challengers of the law , the most sweeping overhaul of U.S. healthcare in decades and President Barack Obama 's signature domestic policy accomplishment .The Supreme Court will issue a ruling by the end of June in the case , in which the plaintiffs have appealed a July ruling by the 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the subsidies .At issue is whether the subsidies - a vital component of Obama 's 2010 Affordable Care Act , known widely as Obamacare - should be available in all 50 states , or only in some states .Obamacare set up health insurance exchanges and a system of subsidies to help people afford insurance premiums . The plaintiffs say the language of the law restricts subsidy availability to states that run their own insurance exchanges .The legal question rests on a phrase in the law that authorizes subsidies for coverage purchased via an `` exchange established by the state . '' The battle is over whether that phrase means subsidies are not available through the federally-run exchange .If the court found the plaintiff 's interpretation to be correct , the subsidies would not be available in 36 states that lack their own health insurance exchanges . In those states , the federal government runs the exchanges .The Obama administration remains confident that Congress wanted the subsidies to be available nationwide , said White House spokesman Josh Earnest in a statement .`` This lawsuit reflects just another partisan attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to strip millions of American families of tax credits that Congress intended for them to have , '' he said shortly after the Supreme Court took the case .The share prices of major hospital chains HCA Holdings Inc , Community Health Systems Inc and Tenet Healthcare Corp closed down more than 4 percent , while shares of health insurers UnitedHealth Group , Aetna Inc and WellPoint Inc dropped nearly 3 percent .Five million people could be affected , analysts have estimated , if the administration loses the legal fight and subsidies disappear from the federal marketplaces . In 2014 , 8 million consumers signed up for healthcare via the exchanges .LIBERTARIAN GROUP BACKS CASEThe plaintiffs in the legal challenge are business owners and individuals who object to the law . The court 's decision to hear the case was welcomed by Sam Kazman , general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a libertarian think tank that is funding the litigation .`` The need for a quick and final resolution of this question is undeniable , '' Kazman said in a statement .David Cutler , a professor of applied economics at Harvard University , said on Friday that if the court throws out the subsidies , “the premiums would skyrocket and the thing would just die . '' He was speaking at an event at The Forum at Harvard School of Public Health in collaboration with Reuters .The case will give the Supreme Court a second shot at reviewing Obamacare . In June 2012 , the nine justices upheld by a 5-4 vote the constitutionality of Obamacare 's core feature that requires people to get health insurance .The court also ruled that the states are not required to sign on to the expansion of the Medicaid assistance program for people on low incomes that the law envisioned as mandatory .The high court’s decision to hear the subsidies availability case is somewhat surprising since there is no split among federal appeals courts on the issue .In July , a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the subsidies , but the court later threw out that ruling and decided to rehear the case . Oral arguments in that case are scheduled for Dec. 17 .The case before the Supreme Court , expected to be argued in early March , is King v. Burwell , U.S. Supreme Court , No . 14-114 .( Reporting by Lawrence Hurley .

WASHINGTON — Republicans will use their new dominance of Congress to repeal or cut back President Barack Obama 's health care reforms , approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline and trim the nation 's debt , House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Thursday .In his first news conference since Republicans seized full control of Congress in Tuesday 's elections , Boehner also warned that Obama will jeopardize any hope of passing immigration reforms during the remainder of his presidency if he uses executive action to loosen immigration regulations .`` I 've made clear to the president , that if he acts unilaterally , on his own , outside of his authority , he will poison the well and there will be no chance of immigration reform moving in this Congress . It 's as simple as that , '' Boehner said .Before the end of this year , Obama is expected to use his executive authority to help possibly millions of undocumented residents who have been living in the United States for an extended period , many raising families here . His actions could allow many of them to seek jobs without fear of deportation .In June 2013 , the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to rewrite immigration laws that was later blocked by House conservatives . Obama has since pledged to help some of the nearly 12 million undocumented people in the United States .After more than 50 failed attempts to repeal or neutralize Obamacare , Boehner said the House would vote again in 2015 to scuttle the law , even if Democrats can still block it in the Senate and it faces a certain veto from Obama .The House will then move quickly to eliminate individual parts of the law , Boehner said , including a tax on medical devices , a provision that Americans without health insurance must pay a tax penalty and a 15-member healthcare payment advisory board expected to launch next year that has been derided by Republicans as a `` death panel . ''Boehner said he believes there are some Democrats who would support such alterations to the healthcare law .`` The American people have made it clear : they 're not for Obamacare . Ask all those Democrats who lost their elections Tuesday night . A lot of them voted for Obamacare , '' he said .The Ohio Republican said the House also would pass dozens of business-friendly bills aimed at boosting job growth and approve TransCanada 's Keystone XL crude oil pipeline , which would connect Canada 's oil sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries .White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was committed to his current review process for the pipeline , and noted there was a clearly established precedent requiring a presidential decision on projects crossing international borders .Obama has said he is studying whether the pipeline would add to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming .`` We have n't seen what Congress is prepared to do , specifically , on this , '' Earnest said , declining to say whether Obama would veto a potential Keystone bill .( Additional reporting by Amanda Becker and Jeff Mason ; Editing by John Whitesides and Dan Grebler )

( Reuters ) - U.S. insurers planning to sell 2015 Obamacare health plans expect at least 20 percent growth in customers and in some states anticipate more than doubling sign-ups .In interviews with Reuters , half a dozen privately held and non-profit health insurers around the country say they are expecting this growth based on interest from potential customers they are hearing about through their call centers , sales forces and brokers .With the start of enrollment barely two weeks away , their assessment is dramatically different from a year ago , when it was unclear how many Americans would apply for the brand new insurance and income-based subsidies offered under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law .Despite crippling technology issues with the HealthCare.gov website , more than 7 million people signed up for Obamacare plans in 2014 .In Florida , Jason Alford , sales director at Health First Health Plans Inc , expects to more than double customers in Affordable Care Act compliant plans from the 4,400 it signed up this year .`` We 've just talked to so many people in the market who for one of 5 or 6 different reasons did n't enroll in 2014 . We had many folks call this summer who really do n't understand the open enrollment period . They are calling in August to sign up for a plan because they think it 's all-year enrollment , '' he explained .When the three-month enrollment period opens on Nov. 15 , it will be a critical juncture for insurers who need to build profitable businesses that can stand up as government financial supports to insurers who sell these plans decline in the next two years .Aimed at extending health insurance to 25 million people , the law has been controversial for its cost to taxpayers and the changes it has spurred in coverage . Millions of individual plans were canceled for 2014 and some employers stopped insuring part-time workers .Support for the law tends to fall along political lines and has waned overall , polls say . Public support fell to 40 percent in 2014 , from 44 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2010 , Harvard researchers said this week .The exchanges have become a big business for insurers like Aetna Inc and WellPoint Inc , who enrolled hundreds of thousands of new customers last year . UnitedHealth Group Inc , barely on the exchanges in 2014 , will be in two dozen states . These insurers have not discussed 2015 forecasts .There is political importance for Obama as well . The Congressional Budget Office expects 13 million people to buy exchange plans in 2015 and 24 million in 2016 . If those numbers materialize , it will make it even more difficult for Republicans and other foes to uproot the embattled law .Insurers would not say whether they agreed with CBO forecasts , but many interviewed by Reuters have doubled or tripled staffing to handle applicants . Some saw customer calls up 30 percent in October . Only those with qualifying events such as job loss can buy insurance outside the regular enrollment period .In Pennsylvania , where Medicaid is being expanded , Independence Blue Cross hopes to add about 30,000 new customers to the 165,000 it signed up for 2014 plans .`` We 're thinking pretty positive . Last week we saw our call center activity increase 31 percent from a call volume standpoint versus the previous few weeks , '' Brian Lobley , a senior vice president at Independence Blue Cross in Pennsylvania , said in an interview .Lobley is seeing growth at a slower pace than CBO suggests because some customers may qualify for benefits under Medicaid when the state makes it available for more residents .In Texas , one small insurer predicts growth of 15,000 to 40,000 more customers from the fewer than 500 it signed up last year .Non-profit insurer Community Health Choice Inc in Houston priced premium rates too high and was mostly shut out in 2014 , said Daisy Morales , vice president of marketing . This year , with more competitive premiums , it expects to win new customers by gaining market share and because of forecasts for growth in the state . The insurer foresees one million new sign-ups in Texas in addition to the more than 700,000 who enrolled in 2014 .`` It 's not like we 're starting from scratch , like we were last year , '' Morales said .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington ; editing by Gunna Dickson )

WASHINGTON — The technology glitches may be a thing of the past . But people shopping online for health insurance plans under U.S. President Barack Obama 's healthcare law may encounter a new set of problems early next year , one of them being unexpected new costs .HealthCare.gov , the federal website where people enroll for insurance under the Affordable Care Act , opens for sign-ups for policies covering 2015 this Saturday , the so-called open enrollment period .The site launched for the first time a year ago but tech snafus made it virtually unuseable for weeks , giving plenty of ammunition for critics of the 2010 law that aimed to make healthcare more affordable for millions of Americans .The website is now much improved , but many consumers may find themselves early in the new year beset by higher costs , unexpected demands for return of subsidies and double-billings .Insurance industry officials , congressional aides and analysts say potential problems will mainly affect current Obamacare policyholders and could intensify public hostility toward the law , just as Republicans - long opposed to the law - take over as a majority in the U.S. Senate in January .The Nov. 15-Feb. 15 open enrollment period allows qualified Americans to obtain private health coverage , often with federally subsidized premiums . Premiums overall appear stable , although some existing plans may rise in price and newer policies may offer consumers better terms .But there is concern about how smoothly the administration will handle the some 5.9 million 2014 policyholders expected to re-enroll . Some experts say the challenge of re-enrolling millions while adding millions of newcomers could be behind this week 's sharp reduction in official enrollment forecasts for 2015 .An estimated 4.4 million people could opt simply to have their policies renewed automatically by Dec. 15 , according to the consulting firm Avalere . But many of those could wind up with unexpectedly higher costs as insurers raise premiums on existing policies , experts say .Even those who actively hunt for cheaper plans could still face issues . Some consumers who cancel existing coverage could initially be billed twice - once for each plan - because the government has no automated system for notifying insurers of such changes , said one insurance industry official , speaking on condition of anonymity .And policyholders who got subsidies to help pay for 2014 coverage could also be told to return some of that money , if their incomes rose later in the year and they did not notify the government .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Frances Kerry )

WASHINGTON — While Republicans in Congress shout , `` Repeal Obamacare , '' GOP governors in many states have quietly accepted the law 's major Medicaid expansion . Even if their party wins control of the Senate in the upcoming elections , they just do n't see the law going away .Nine Republican governors have expanded Medicaid for low-income people in their states , despite their own misgivings and adamant opposition from conservative legislators . Three more governors are negotiating with the Democratic administration in Washington .Rather than demanding repeal , the governors generally have sought federal concessions to make their decisions more politically acceptable at home . That approach is in sharp contrast to the anti-Obamacare fervor of their party in Congress .Ohio Gov . John Kasich says he does n't think there will be a repeal in Washington , even if Republicans win a Senate majority and consolidate their hold on the House in next month 's election .`` That 's not gon na happen , '' the Republican governor told The Associated Press during a recent re-election campaign swing .Kasich called The Associated Press Monday night to clarify that he was speaking specifically about a repeal of Medicaid expansion and not of the entire Affordable Care Act __ although opponents in Washington do n't usually draw such distinctions .He said he believes the ACA `` can and should '' be repealed , but that opposition to the Medicaid expansion `` was really either political or ideological , '' adding , `` I do n't think that holds water against real flesh and blood and real improvements in people 's lives . ''He has cast the Medicaid expansion in Ohio as a moral choice to help the poor .While `` repeal '' remains the mantra for many Republicans in Washington , it 's up against some hard facts .As Kasich suggested , millions of people now have a tangible benefit that would be taken away if the health law were repealed . Any GOP replacement law would probably have to give most of those people a way to remain insured , and that would involve considerable taxpayer expense and government regulation .And even if Democrats lose their Senate majority , President Barack Obama still has the power to veto legislation . Republicans would have to muster a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress to override that .`` What we would anticipate is most likely to happen , even with a Republican Senate , is we 'd have to work within the confines of where we are , '' said Marty Carpenter , spokesman for Republican Gov . Gary Herbert of Utah . Herbert wants federal approval to deliver the Medicaid expansion through private insurance companies — as some other GOP governors have done .Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad , another Republican seeking re-election , says `` major changes '' are required to the health care law . But he expects his state 's Medicaid expansion to stand .`` I think our system and our approach is working , and I think other states are starting to look at our approach , '' Branstad said .In a recent debate with his Democratic election opponent , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that Obama 's health care law must be pulled up `` root and branch . '' But he hastened to add that the state could somehow still keep its insurance marketplace , which owes its existence to Obama 's law .Here are some of the hurdles that congressional Republicans would face , even if they won big on Nov. 4 .— A straightforward repeal bill could be filibustered in the Senate , giving Democrats a chance to turn the tables on Republicans who have used that tactic in recent years .— Democrats used budget rules to avoid a filibuster and pass the law in 2010 . That same budget process might be used by Republicans to unravel the law . But they might not kill all of it , only the parts with a direct impact on the federal budget , leaving an unworkable jumble of insurance rules . And Obama could still veto it .— Forcing a government shutdown or a debt default to try to get rid of the health law would probably backfire politically . Republican leaders want to avoid that , though some conservative activists say nothing should be off the table .— There 's no consensus among Republicans over how to replace Obamacare . Some believe a new plan would have to come from the party 's 2016 presidential nominee .Still , the nation can expect repeal votes if Republicans win the Senate , to fulfill campaign promises . What might happen after an Obama veto is less clear .Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyo. , a member of the GOP leadership , says Republicans will target unpopular provisions and try to get some Democrats to join them .`` Obviously , we are going to try to fully repeal the law , '' said Barrasso . `` The reality is President Obama is going to be in office , and we know how that is going to turn out if we get a bill to his desk . If we can not get a full repeal , we will try to bring forth a number of bills that target the worst parts of the law . ''The bottom line : Former Utah Gov . Mike Leavitt , a Republican who served as Health and Human Services secretary for President George W. Bush , says Washington lawmakers and state governors are playing on different levels .`` In the Washington world , things are about control of the news cycle and preparing for the next election , '' said Leavitt . `` Governors are more interested in finding a way they can be comfortable in their own skins and solve problems .

WASHINGTON — One part of the Affordable Care Act is going according to plan , with U.S. states receiving and spending more money on the Medicaid health insurance program , a report released by the National Association of State Budget Officers on Thursday showed .States run Medicaid , which serves families who have low incomes , and receive partial reimbursements from the federal government . The healthcare overhaul known as Obamacare allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid and also gave states 90 percent to 100 percent reimbursements for new enrollees .`` The large increase in federal funds to states in fiscal 2014 was almost solely due to additional Medicaid dollars , mainly resulting from the expansion of Medicaid in a majority of states under the Affordable Care Act , '' the association found . `` While federal Medicaid funds to states increased $ 41.8 billion in fiscal 2014 , all other federal funds to states are estimated to have declined $ 3.4 billion . ''For most states , fiscal 2014 ended on June 30 .Medicaid spending rose the most of all states ' budget areas , increasing 11.3 percent in fiscal 2014 , but the federal government shouldered most of the burden . Federal funding for Medicaid increased 17.8 percent , and state dollars directed to the program only grew 2.7 percent , according to NASBO .Before Obamacare , Medicaid had each year eaten up a larger portion of state spending . In fiscal 2014 , it was states ' biggest budget item , consuming slightly more than a quarter of all state expenditures . Elementary and secondary education , though , remains the largest category of spending exclusively from state funds , representing 24.2 percent of state funds , compared to 15.3 percent for Medicaid .States have become less reliant on federal funds since the U.S. stimulus plan expired and Congress enacted `` sequestration '' spending cuts . When the stimulus plan 's infusion of cash ended in fiscal 2010 , federal funds represented 34.9 percent of state spending . In fiscal 2014 federal funds backed 30.3 percent of state spending .NASBO found spending in almost all budget categories edged up slightly last fiscal year , with only the `` all other '' and public assistance categories declining . Higher education spending rose 3.7 percent , corrections increased 4 percent , and transportation was up 2.7 percent .`` Looking forward , states remain concerned about both the short- and long-term outlook due to increased spending demands , recent volatility in states revenues , and uncertainty surrounding future federal fiscal policies , '' NASBO found .( Reporting By Lisa Lambert ; Editing by Cynthia Osterman )

WASHINGTON — Enroll America , the U.S. government 's private-sector flagship for reaching Americans who lack health insurance , has raised less money than last year to promote enrollment in Obamacare health plans but still expects to reach more consumers .The group , closely aligned with the White House and backed by healthcare companies and nonprofit groups , said on Wednesday it has collected $ 20 million from donors this year , down from $ 27 million a year ago .The announcement came just ahead of Saturday 's start to the Affordable Care Act 's new three-month open enrollment period , when eligible consumers can enroll in federally subsidized private insurance through online marketplaces in all 50 states .Analysts and other experts say the enrollment effort should begin more smoothly than last year 's botched rollout . But it faces tangible challenges signing up millions of people over a shorter time period , while Republicans in Congress renew their call for the law 's repeal . The administration dramatically cut 2015 enrollment expectations this week to 9.1 million people , from 13 million .Enroll America officials say the larger pot of money last year included donations to help with start-up costs and said it expects to reach 1.4 million consumers in person or by phone in 11 states .The group reached about 927,000 people through those avenues last time and expects to surpass the 5 million total that it claims to have reached for 2014 coverage through additional routes including email , social media and partner organizations .“We have the resources to get it done , ” Enroll America President Anne Filipic told reporters .Filipic pointed to two new high-tech products including an online `` Get Covered Connector '' tool to help interested consumers talk to specialists who can help them enroll in coverage , and a special database for locating uninsured people .The group , which boasts more than 4,600 partner organizations , said the two products have been adopted by allied outreach groups in an additional 11 states , bringing the effort 's total marketing reach to 22 states .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by David Gregorio )

WASHINGTON — After years of trying to repeal Obamacare , Republicans are planning a new strategy to eliminate some of the law 's most unpopular provisions by using targeted legislation with the potential to attract enough Democratic votes to reach President Barack Obama 's desk .First they have to pick up the six seats they need for a U.S. Senate majority in Tuesday 's midterm elections , which would give the party control of both congressional chambers for the first time since 2006 .With opinion polls showing the odds for Senate control increasingly in their favor , Republicans are exploring a series of efforts to repeal some of Obamacare 's taxes and penalties on businesses .The Affordable Care Act , Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement , aims to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by offering subsidized private coverage to lower income Americans and by extending Medicaid program for the poor .But the law has been a target for constant Republican attack since Congress enacted it in 2010 , when both chambers were controlled by Democrats . Republicans view it as an unworkable expansion of big government that will only raise healthcare costs while hurting businesses , job growth and the economy .A Republican-controlled Congress would still be expected to kick off in January with separate bills to repeal the entire law , as well as the penalty for individual Americans who fail to obtain health coverage and the federal subsidies for low-income people enrolled in private Obamacare health policies .Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell came under fire from conservatives critics last week after saying the party was unlikely to have the 60 Senate votes , out of 100 , needed to repeal the law with standard legislation . A McConnell spokesman said his position had not changed : a Republican-controlled Senate would still see a full repeal vote and McConnell remained committed to undoing the law 's funding provisions through a special parliamentary process requiring only a simple 51-vote majority .But with a White House veto of such measures all but certain , Republicans hope to move on quickly to legislation capable of drawing enough Democrats to surmount the Senate 's legislative hurdles and put pressure on Obama to acquiesce , lawmakers and aides said .Chief among Republican targets is the ACA 's employer mandate , which requires businesses with at least 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to their employees or pay a penalty . Also on the hit list are the law 's definition of `` full time '' as any employee who works 30 hours a week or more , provisions that compensate health insurers for market losses and an excise tax on medical devices , including the machines that produce CAT scans and magnetic resonance images .`` There 's consensus that we need to tear down the most destructive parts of the law that are hurting people and are hurting our economy . And there 's proven bipartisan support for some of our ideas , '' said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming , an orthopedic surgeon and a leading Republican voice on healthcare .Employer requirements and taxes have also been the subject of intense lobbying by the business community , including medical device manufacturers , while risk provisions that seek to reduce insurer losses have become a favorite target for Tea Party-backed conservatives who warn of a looming government `` bailout '' for the insurance industry .Some measures have won support from senators in both parties , including Republican Orrin Hatch 's budget resolution amendment last year to repeal the excise tax on medical devices . That measure was blocked from a later floor vote by Democratic leaders .There also could be room for negotiations between parties once the repeal efforts run their course . Democratic Senate aides say they have talked to Republican aides about compromises including streamlining reporting requirements for employers and replacing the tax penalty with an incentive for firms to offer health coverage to workers .Both parties could add proposals to tweak Obamacare to broader pieces of legislation , such as a budget or appropriations bill .`` That is the old fashioned way of passing legislation . You pull together a bunch of things that could have gone separately , you find a way to pay for them and you get enough people to hold their noses and vote for it , ” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by John Whitesides and Frances Kerry )

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . — Remember the Affordable Care Act , the Obama administration’s signature health care plan ? Of course you do : For four years , it was at the epicenter of a vicious partisan battle in the United States , the subject of town meetings , congressional debates and talk show vitriol , not to mention the target of more than 800,000 negative television ads that cost an estimated $ 450 million .Then there was the disastrous rollout in late 2013 , caused by computer glitches that cost the program precious credibility at a critical time .That’s what most people remember — which might explain why some Republicans seeking election next month are still running attack ads against the health care law . The problem with that narrative is the program is proving to be a success , and yet the health care initiative — arguably the most significant piece of social legislation in decades — is no longer a prominent part of the Democratic agenda .“The program has turned a corner , ” said Anton Gunn , a former South Carolina state legislator and health care expert , now on a fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvard . According to government figures released in September , 7.3 million people had signed up and paid for health plans delivered by state and federal exchanges as of mid-August ; the total is more than 10 million if children on parental plans are included , according to Mr. Gunn .Not bad for a program that opponents argued would ruin small businesses , put families at risk , force citizens to drop existing insurance policies and generally destroy America with a lethal dose of European-style socialism .Never mind that most Europeans like their health care systems , and were typically horrified to learn that some 40 million Americans had no health insurance at all . The fact that the number of uninsured is now dropping should be good news not only for the United States itself , but also for its image in the world .Yet Democratic candidates are largely shying away from the issue in this election season , as described in a recent talk at Harvard by Amy Walter , an editor of the Cook Political Report , a nonpartisan group that analyzes campaigns . Democrats have calculated that they have nothing to gain by bringing it up . For one thing , most Americans are unaffected by the new plans because they are insured through their employer . For another , health insurance is the kind of complicated issue that gets little traction on the campaign trail .What does resonate in the Republican-leaning states is the word Obamacare , the informal if widely used name for the program that serves as a handy proxy for an increasingly unpopular president . This is where the ads have had their biggest effect . “They don’t like him , so they don’t like it , ” said Mr. Gunn .But as the program picks up enrollees , even Obama-bashers are having to shift targets . “It’s not the focus of the G.O.P . anymore , ” Mr. Gunn said . “They’re onto other issues — ISIS , Ebola , which I’m sure they’ll figure out a way to blame Obama for.”Already , some of the health program’s fiercest opponents are turning themselves into pretzels over the issue . The Senate minority leader , Mitch McConnell , running for re-election in Kentucky , has argued that “the best interest of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare , root and branch , ” while at the same time , defending Kentucky’s health insurance exchange , which has enrolled 500,000 people .Experts expect enrollment to climb to 13 million people after the second application period opens on Nov. 15 . They also predict that state lawmakers will start to see a political benefit to participating in a program that obliges states to expand Medicaid , the program that subsidizes health care for the poor , at the federal government’s expense .Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , recently wrote that the attraction of federal funds and the votes of the newly insured “may gradually trump ideology , ” prompting the 23 states that initially refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion to opt in .“Once we’re past the election season , we can start working on testimonials about Obamacare , calling people out on it , ” Mr. Gunn said . Until then , the program’s supporters are staying mum .

WASHINGTON — In a win for the Obama administration on insurance coverage for contraception under Obamacare , a U.S. appeals court on Friday ruled that Catholic non-profit groups ' religious rights were not violated by a compromise already achieved on the volatile issue .Catholic groups had sued over the compromise , saying they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion , but a judge wrote in the ruling that under the compromise , `` the regulations do not compel them to do that . ''Handed down by a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Circuit , the unanimous decision is the third by an appeals court to rule in favor of the government . The issue could yet be decided by the Supreme Court .The court ruled that the compromise on contraception coverage , issued in 2013 and amended in August , did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs ' religious beliefs , which would be a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .Judge Nina Pillard wrote in the decision that the compromise helps the plaintiffs wash `` their hands of any involvement in providing insurance for contraceptive services . ''The compromise allows the groups to avoid paying for the coverage required under the 2010 Affordable Care Act , often known as Obamacare . Groups can certify they are opting out , which then forces insurers to pick up the tab .The Catholic groups that sued , Priests for Life and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington , argued the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees , even if they are not technically paying for it . Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement .The ruling comes five months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that closely-held companies could , on religious grounds , seek exemptions from the contraception provision . Days later , in a case similar to the Washington dispute , the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues .( Reporting by Lawrence Hurley ; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Alan Crosby )

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama 's plan to extend private health coverage to the uninsured entered a new uncertain phase on Saturday as U.S. government-backed online insurance marketplaces opened their 2015 plans to millions of potential enrollees .The HealthCare.gov website relaunched with little fanfare and appeared to work smoothly early in the day , a far cry from technical glitches that shut down the operation within minutes of its opening a year ago and drove Democrat Obama 's signature domestic policy to the brink of disaster , exposing him to criticism from Republicans who have campaigned for its repeal .But problems emerged later . Washington state 's health insurance marketplace , one of 14 state-run exchanges , went offline after officials learned of errors in federal subsidy calculations .Separately , U.S. officials were unable to confirm a USA Today report of new glitches on HealthCare.gov for some website visitors . `` The vast majority of users are having a smooth experience during the first day of open enrollment , '' said administration spokesman Aaron Albright .An analyst who monitored Saturday 's federal and state website operations for consulting firm Leavitt Partners said the Obamacare sites generally appeared to be problem free and capable of hosting vast numbers of consumers .More than 23,000 people had applied for 2015 coverage by 9 a.m. EST ( 1400 GMT ) , officials said . There was no word on total traffic but daily volume was expected to rise into next week .Lower-income adults who are young , black or Hispanic remain a key audience , because large numbers lack health insurance .Specialists trained to help people apply for coverage at the University of South Florida saw walk-ins as well as applicants who had made appointments . They said the website was responding quickly and easily .Officials , who have concentrated on producing a smooth experience for consumers , phased in the operation by allowing people to window shop for plans over the past week and then launching on a weekend . The site attracted 1.2 million unique visitors for shopping ahead of Saturday 's start , officials said .But the administration is also hedging its bets by acknowledging potential problems , such as outages , as traffic to the site swells . Officials greatly reduced their overall 2015 target to 9.1 million enrollees from 13 million .A new Republican majority in Congress in January is committed to repealing or dismantling the healthcare law .

WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Monday that the federal government 's goal is to have 9.1 million people enrolled in private health coverage through Obamacare marketplaces next year .A report released earlier by the administration forecast an enrollment total ranging from 9 million to 9.9 million people , compared with a prediction of 13 million enrollees issued earlier this year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .A 9.1 million enrollment total , including new applicants and returning customers , would represent a 28 percent increase from the latest 2014 total of 7.1 million , Burwell said .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Susan Heavey )

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks closed little changed on Friday , pressured by renewed uncertainty in healthcare stocks and by Disney shares , even as October payrolls data pointed to a resilient economy in the face of sluggish global growth .The S & P 500 and Dow industrials closed at record highs and rose for a third consecutive week .Health insurers fell sharply after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law that , if successful , would limit the availability of federal health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans .`` Any kind of change in how the healthcare law is interpreted is going to affect healthcare stocks , probably insurers first , '' said Kim Forrest , senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh .`` Whenever the rules have potential to change everybody gets nervous . ''UnitedHealth Group fell 2.7 percent to $ 93.61 , ranking as the largest weight on the Dow industrials . Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 6.5 percent to $ 47.85 while managed care facilities operator Humana Inc was down 6.6 percent to $ 130.58 .Healthcare stocks had been pressured from the opening bell by Salix Pharmaceuticals , which closed down 34 percent at $ 91.47 in its biggest-ever daily drop .Salix on Thursday slashed its full-year forecast given swollen drug inventories , an issue that dissuaded Allergan from acquiring the drugmaker , people familiar with the matter said .On the flip side , employers added 214,000 jobs last month , below the 231,000 expected in a Reuters poll of economists , while gains in the previous two months were revised higher . The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent , the lowest since July 2008 , even as more people entered the labor force .`` With data like this the Federal Reserve does n't feel compelled to come in and help , or squash a too-hot economy , '' said Fort Pitt Capital 's Forrest . `` No more Fed ( asset ) buying but also no rate hikes quite yet .

WASHINGTON — The White House said on Friday it was confident a new legal challenge to Obamacare at the U.S. Supreme Court would be unsuccessful .`` This lawsuit reflects just another partisan attempt to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to strip millions of American families of tax credits that Congress intended for them to have , '' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement .`` We are confident that the Supreme Court will recognize both the clear reading of the entire law , and the certain intent of Congress in crafting it , '' Earnest said .( Reporting by Roberta Rampton ; Editing by Jim Loney )

My parents used to own a small house with a large backyard , in which my mother cultivated a beautiful garden . At some point , however — I don’t remember why — my father looked at the official deed defining their property , and received a shock . According to the text , the Krugman lot wasn’t a rough rectangle ; it was a triangle more than a hundred feet long but only around a yard wide at the base .On examination , it was clear what had happened : Whoever wrote down the lot’s description had somehow skipped a clause . And of course the town clerk fixed the language . After all , it would have been ludicrous and cruel to take away most of my parents’ property on the basis of sloppy drafting , when the drafters’ intention was perfectly clear .But it now appears possible that the Supreme Court may be willing to deprive millions of Americans of health care on the basis of an equally obvious typo . And if you think this possibility has anything to do with serious legal reasoning , as opposed to rabid partisanship , I have a long , skinny , unbuildable piece of land you might want to buy .Last week the court shocked many observers by saying that it was willing to hear a case claiming that the wording of one clause in the Affordable Care Act sets drastic limits on subsidies to Americans who buy health insurance . It’s a ridiculous claim ; not only is it clear from everything else in the act that there was no intention to set such limits , you can ask the people who drafted the law what they intended , and it wasn’t what the plaintiffs claim . But the fact that the suit is ridiculous is no guarantee that it won’t succeed — not in an environment in which all too many Republican judges have made it clear that partisan loyalty trumps respect for the rule of law .To understand the issue , you need to understand the structure of health reform . The Affordable Care Act tries to establish more-or-less universal coverage through a “three-legged stool” of policies , all of which are needed to make the system work . First , insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against Americans based on their medical history , so that they can’t deny coverage or impose exorbitant premiums on people with pre-existing conditions . Second , everyone is required to buy insurance , to ensure that the healthy don’t wait until they get sick to join up . Finally , there are subsidies to lower-income Americans to make the insurance they’re required to buy affordable .Just as an aside , so far this system seems to be working very well . Enrollment is running above expectations , premiums well below , and more insurance companies are flocking to the market .So what’s the problem ? To receive subsidies , Americans must buy insurance through so-called exchanges , government-run marketplaces . These exchanges , in turn , take two forms . Many states have chosen to run their own exchanges , like Covered California or Kentucky’s Kynect . Other states , however — mainly those under G.O.P . control — have refused to take an active role in insuring the uninsured , and defaulted to exchanges run by the federal government ( which are working well now that the original software problems have been resolved ) .But if you look at the specific language authorizing those subsidies , it could be taken — by an incredibly hostile reader — to say that they’re available only to Americans using state-run exchanges , not to those using the federal exchanges .As I said , everything else in the act makes it clear that this was not the drafters’ intention , and in any case you can ask them directly , and they’ll tell you that this was nothing but sloppy language . Furthermore , the consequences if the suit were to prevail would be grotesque . States like California that run their own exchanges would be unaffected . But in places like New Jersey , where G.O.P . politicians refused to take a role , premiums would soar , healthy individuals would drop out , and health reform would go into a death spiral . ( And since many people would lose crucial , lifesaving coverage , the deaths wouldn’t be just a metaphor . )Now , states could avoid this death spiral by establishing exchanges — which might involve nothing more than setting up links to the federal exchange . But how did we get to this point ?Once upon a time , this lawsuit would have been literally laughed out of court . Instead , however , it has actually been upheld in some lower courts , on straight party-line votes — and the willingness of the Supremes to hear it is a bad omen .So let’s be clear about what’s happening here . Judges who support this cruel absurdity aren’t stupid ; they know what they’re doing . What they are , instead , is corrupt , willing to pervert the law to serve political masters . And what we’ll find out in the months ahead is how deep the corruption goes .

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday took no action on a closely watched case that challenges a key part of the Obamacare healthcare law and could limit the availability of federal health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans .The legal fight concerns whether the subsidies vital to the implantation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act should be available in all 50 states or only in some . The case was brought by conservative challengers to the law who were appealing a July ruling by the 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the subsidies .The high court could have announced on Monday whether or not it would hear the case . The next chance for the court to announce if it plans to take it up is Nov. 10 .The healthcare law , considered one of President Barack Obama 's signature achievements , set up health insurance exchanges and tax-credit subsidies to help people afford insurance premiums . The measure , intended to give Americans greater access to affordable health insurance , was passed by Congress despite unified opposition from Republicans .In 2014 , 8 million consumers signed up for healthcare coverage via the exchanges . The plaintiffs say that , based on the language in the law , the subsidies may only be paid in states that have their own online health insurance exchanges . A total of 36 states do not have exchanges of their own .Five million people could be affected , analysts have estimated , if the Obama administration loses the legal fight and subsidies disappear from the federal marketplaces that have been set up in states that did not create their own exchanges .The case is King v. Burwell , U.S. Supreme Court , No . 14-114 .( Reporting by Lawrence Hurley ; Editing by Will Dunham )

WASHINGTON — Obama administration officials on Wednesday said an improved HealthCare.gov website should be able to break its own record for online traffic next month , when consumers begin using the site to enroll in private health insurance for 2015 .Andrew Slavitt , a top U.S. official working to implement the law known as Obamacare , said the goal for traffic capacity is `` significantly more than on the highest peak day . '' That peak day was March 31 , the last official day for 2014 enrollments , when the site handled more than 125,000 users at a time , for a total daily volume of 4.8 million visitors .The goal suggests growing confidence among administration officials that the new three-month open enrollment period for 2015 , which begins Nov. 15 , will not see a repeat of last year 's botched rollout , when HealthCare.gov crashed on launch and brought President Barack Obama 's presidency and his signature domestic policy to the brink of political crisis .An emergency rescue operation led by technology experts including Slavitt got HealthCare.gov operating smoothly enough to enroll 8 million people for 2014 coverage . Independent forecasts call for a 2015 enrollment of 13 million , including current policyholders who renew existing coverage and 5 million to 6 million new enrollees .`` We 're in a very different spot than we were last year , when we were building from whole cloth . Now we 've got a body of knowledge that we 're continuing to build and learn against , '' Slavitt told reporters at a press briefing .But he declined to rule out problems once enrollment resumes : `` Where we 're focused is on a successful consumer experience . And that 's kind of where we 're heads-down . ''HealthCare.gov and the government 's technological backbone for subsidized private insurance marketplaces in all 50 states began end-to-end testing on Tuesday , which officials described as a painstaking procedure involving hundreds of participants from government and the health insurance industry .Slavitt said the testing , which will continue for 5-1/2 weeks , marks the fourth round of tests for the system .The administration gave reporters a glimpse at its new , streamlined HealthCare.gov design , intended to ease the task of enrollment . The new 16-screen application , down from 76 screens in the 2014 enrollment , has been tested by 20,000 consumers who have been allowed to sign up for coverage since July because of special circumstances .A new feature is a mobile function that will allow people to enroll through smart phones and other devices . Officials said such devices are popular among 70 percent of Latinos and 80 percent of young adults , two key target audiences .Officials said consumers will be able to browse 2015 health plans , with their potentially higher premium rates , around Nov. 9 , a week before open enrollment begins and days after the Nov. 4 congressional midterm elections .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky )

WASHINGTON — A nonpartisan congressional agency is raising new questions about compliance with a key compromise on abortion that allowed the federal health care law to pass in 2010 .The Government Accountability Office said in a report released late Monday that only 1 of 18 insurers it reviewed was separately itemizing a charge for coverage of elective abortions on enrollees ' bills .That detail is important because the original compromise that President Barack Obama sealed with anti-abortion Democrats stipulated that no federal funds would be used to pay for elective abortions . Instead , private health plans covering the procedure would collect a separate premium , which would be segregated from federal subsidies for other medical services .Although abortion is a legal medical procedure , longstanding federal laws prohibit taxpayer funds from being used to pay for it , except in cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother .The new GAO review did not address the fundamental question of whether federal subsidies under the health law are being used for elective abortions , but abortion opponents said the findings underscore their view that the compromise is an accounting gimmick .In a written response , the Health and Human Services Department said it `` acknowledges that additional clarification may be needed '' when it comes to the health law 's provisions on abortions .The report also found that some insurers were unaware of a requirement in the law that they notify policyholders if they cover elective abortions . Abortion opponents have complained that it 's very difficult for average consumers to determine whether or not their plan covers the procedure . Abortion supporters say they would also like clearer information .Most health plans offered through employers routinely cover abortions . The health care law created new state insurance markets where people who do n't have access to job-based coverage can buy a government-subsidized policy . The flow of taxpayer dollars to insurers in the new exchanges created another battleground for opponents and supporters of abortion .The compromise on abortion allowed Obama to secure votes from a small group of Democratic lawmakers who traditionally voted in favor of restrictions on abortion funding . Their support was critical in the face of overwhelming Republican opposition to the legislation .The GAO report focused on 27 states , plus Washington , D.C. , that do not have laws restricting access to elective abortions in the new health insurance markets . Another 23 states restrict or bar coverage .The GAO found that 1,036 plans in these 27 states covered elective abortions , while 1,062 did not .The 18 insurers that the agency reviewed accounted for nearly one-fourth of the plans that covered abortion . Each insurer offered multiple plans . None of the companies or plans were identified in the report .All but one of the insurers said the cost of providing abortion coverage averaged out to less than $ 1 a month across their entire group of policyholders . In some cases it was as low as 10 cents a month .The one insurer that itemized the abortion coverage charge on its monthly bill said it describes it as being `` for coverage of services for which member subsidies may not be used . ''The report was released by Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee .

HARRISBURG Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama’s plan to extend health coverage to millions of poor Americans remains highly contentious , yet it is gaining momentum among several initially reluctant states where financial pragmatism is trumping ideology .Up to a dozen states , including several led by Republicans , could move forward with plans to expand coverage under Medicaid after the November elections . They take their cue from Pennsylvania and other states that have won Washington 's approval to add commercial innovations to the 50-year-old government program to make it more palatable to conservatives .Obama 's original idea of using tax money to expand Medicaid has long been a hot button for Republicans who portray the whole Obamacare healthcare overhaul as a form of socialism encroaching on American values of free enterprise and self-reliance . Texas Governor Rick Perry once said expanding Medicaid would be similar to `` adding a thousand people to the Titanic.”But two things have led to a change of heart for some Republican politicians .Most of the 27 states that are already expanding the program have begun to reap billions in federal subsidies for insurers , hospitals and healthcare providers , putting politicians elsewhere under intense pressure to follow suit .As demonstrated by Pennsylvania 's deal with Washington , the Obama administration has also proved willing to accept tweaks that give the private sector a greater role in providing healthcare and place new responsibilities on beneficiaries .All of that has got as many as nine states talking to the administration about potential expansion terms , with the possibility of up to three more joining the fray depending on November 's election outcomes . As a result , there could be even more pressure on Republican states that have opted out , providing critical mass for an initiative central to Obamacare .Heading into the final two years of his presidency , Obama wants to cement his legacy , a big part of which is his pledge to reduce the number of uninsured Americans .NEW WAVE“Pennsylvania’s the leading edge of what could be a new wave of expanding states , ” said Deborah Bachrach , a Medicaid expert at the law and consulting firm Manatt , Phelps & Phillips .“This would marginalize the non-expansion states to the considerable detriment of their citizens and put pressure on those who oppose expansion , ” she said .Some states with Republican governors , such as Indiana , are negotiating with Washington for agreements that could pass political muster with conservatives back home . Others such as North Carolina , South Dakota and Wyoming are exploring options .In Florida , Wisconsin and Maine , the outcome of the Nov. 4 election could bring a shift on Medicaid if Democrats win gubernatorial races there .Administration officials have said they are committed to working with all states to expand the scheme and noted that the number of the uninsured has declined much more in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage .A possible new wave of expansion comes as prospects for the broad Obamacare reform are also looking up . After a rocky start a year ago , research suggests that more than 10 million people have gained health coverage under the law .But that momentum could get lost if Republicans win control of the U.S. Senate and begin pressuring Obama to scale back the reform .Pennsylvania 's turbulent journey into the Medicaid fold offers a possible template for others , including the possibility of a political reversal if Republican Governor Tom Corbett loses his reelection bid . In polls , he is well behind Democratic challenger Tom Wolf , who favors expanding Medicaid and keeping its traditional structure intact .Corbett , who took part in a Supreme Court challenge to the Medicaid expansion , had opposed enlarging a government program without substantial change . A pro-Medicaid coalition of more than 100 groups responded with intense lobbying during the budget approval process in early 2013 .“We had advocacy days , drive-ins , invited lawmakers in to talk about what’s important , encouraged people to talk to their local chambers of commerce and organized educational opportunities , ” said Paula Bussard , policy chief at the Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania , which represents 250 institutions .A study by the RAND Corp predicted a $ 3 billion economic boost and the creation of 35,000 jobs – big advantages for a state that has struggled for decades to make up for jobs lost from the decline of the coal and steel industries.Corbett met in Washington with former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in April 2013 and a year of intensive talks followed .Pennsylvania won approval for only a handful of the two dozen innovations it sought , such as permission to offer benefits through private insurers and impose premium charges on beneficiaries who earn more than the federal poverty level .The program will also include incentives for beneficiaries to practice healthy behavior including screenings and set benefit packages according to commercial standards .Pennsylvania officials say that while a compromise proved possible , that did not mean convergence in political positions .“The administration comes from a different philosophical background , ” said Jennifer Branstetter , Corbett’s policy chief . “They want to make sure that the program’s there for everybody . And we want to make sure it’s there if you need it . ''Other Republican-led states hope the Obama administration will allow even greater flexibility .“The hope is that they 'll be less interested in the purity of their original vision and be more interested in cutting deals to get some of these things done , '' said Tony Venhuizen , spokesman for South Dakota’s Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard , who has been open to a Medicaid expansion .In some states , pro-expansion politicians are trying to win conservative support by pushing market-based innovations that over time could trim the cost of traditional Medicaid .`` Eventually , they could meld together , '' said Nebraska Senator Kathy Campbell , a Republican who has helped lead discussions with Washington .But while the turning tide on Medicaid bodes well for Obamacare , Republicans refuse to concede any points in the ideological battle around the healthcare model .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Caren Bohan and Tomasz Janowski )

( Reuters ) - One of the most highly contentious Obamacare programs , which calls on states to expand their publicly-funded healthcare for the poor , could see a second wave of participation by U.S. states later this year or early in 2015 , according to state officials and independent analysts .Following are states whose governor 's offices or legislators have held talks with President Barack Obama 's administration about possible options for extending healthcare coverage known as Medicaid to uninsured low-income residents .Also included are the financial costs and benefits they could see over the coming decade by opting for expansion .The Obama administration says it will cover 100 percent of the cost of expansion through 2016 , and never less than 90 percent thereafter , a prospect that would mean billions of dollars in new federal funding for even sparsely populated states . But Republicans worry that the federal government 's commitment could weaken over time , leaving states to foot some substantial Medicaid bills .The Medicaid expansion is part of a broader reform under the law called Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , which aims to reduce healthcare costs , now the highest in the world , make health insurance more affordable and limit the number of uninsured Americans .Medicaid was created in the 1960s along with the federal program Medicare , which provides health coverage for the elderly . Most Medicaid coverage , jointly financed by federal and state money , has gone to narrowly defined groups including children , pregnant women and the severely disabled – a fact that has left millions of poor adults without healthcare until now .The following data comes from a report by the nonpartisan Urban Institute . Estimates are in the billions of dollars .State State Costs New Federal FundingIndiana $ 1.099 $ 17.3Missouri 1.573 17.8Montana 0.194 2.1North Carolina 3.075 39.6South Dakota 0.157 2.1Tennessee 1.715 22.5Utah 0.364 5.3Wyoming 0.118 1.4Three other states , which have rejected the Medicaid expansion up to now , could be in a position to reverse course if their Republican governors lose reelection to Democratic challengers in the November election , analysts say .They are:States State Costs New Federal FundingFlorida $ 5.364 $ 66.1Maine -0.570* 3.1Wisconsin -0.248* 12.3*Some states are shown with state Medicaid savings , indicated by a negative entry , based on expectations that adults will continue to receive Medicaid benefits under pre-Obamacare programs .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Tomasz Janowski )

( Reuters ) - The number of insurers offering individual health plans on the Obamacare exchanges will increase about 25 percent in 2015 and that should keep down prices , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday in a report .More than 7 million people signed up for health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , which were created under President Barack Obama 's national healthcare reform law and offer income-based subsidies .Next year , there will be 63 additional issuers in the 44 states for which it has data , the agency said in a report . Some insurers left the market , it said .Healthcare.gov , which sells insurance in 36 states , will have 248 issuers in 2015 , an increase of 30 percent from 2014 , it said .`` We 're seeing it as evidence that these are attractive marketplaces , and just from our casual review of investor communications by the firms , these are being seen as growth opportunities , '' an HHS official said .The nation 's largest health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc , which offered only a few plans in 2014 , submitted plans in more than two dozen states . Other large insurers have said they have either maintained or increased their presence on the exchanges for 2015 . Aetna Inc , Humana Incand WellPoint Inc all offer more than a dozen plans .Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell cited the increase in the number of insurers selling plans and a study showing that 7 in 10 Americans find the coverage affordable . `` There 's no surprise ... that when folks evaluate the success of the law , the marketplace receives much of the attention , '' she said in prepared remarks for a speech at Brookings .The report said past data has shown that for each additional insurer , the monthly premium price in that market declines for the benchmark plan by 4 percent .Based on the data collected for the 44 states , only California is expected to have a decline in the number of insurers offering plans to 10 from 12 . New Hampshire and West Virginia , which both had only 1 insurer offering plans in 2014 , will increase to 5 insurers and 2 insurers respectively . Each insurer is counted as one issuer in each state where it sells plans .There are six states running their own online marketplaces whose information was not included in the report . They include Hawaii , Kentucky Minnesota , Massachusetts , Nevada , Oregon , and Vermont .( Reporting by Caroline Humer and David Morgan in Washington D.C. ; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andrew Hay )



BOSTON — New competition between health insurers offering so-called Obamacare plans in 2015 is having an impact on the pricing of such coverage , based on a first look at proposed insurance premiums , the head of Humana Inc said on Wednesday .The state insurance exchanges offering coverage under the Affordable Care Act . President Barack Obama 's landmark healthcare law will begin enrolling customers for 2015 benefits in mid-November . Now in its second year , Obamacare is attracting health insurers to offer plans in more states after over 8 million people enrolled for coverage in 2014 .The country 's largest insurer , UnitedHealth Group Inc , sold Obamacare plans in only a few states in 2014 . But for 2015 , it will sell plans in about two dozen states . Aetna Inc , Cigna Corp , WellPoint Inc and Humana have said they would stick to most of their markets .`` United is coming in . There is more competition coming into the marketplace . It 's going to make us all a little bit more competitive , '' Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in an interview .He said that larger insurers are pricing their premiums within a narrower range of about 10 percent in many markets . That strategy contrasts with 2014 , when Obamacare plan pricing showed much greater variation .Humana will sell plans in 15 states for 2015 and has asked for premium rate increases of 3 percent to the 20 percent range , depending on the market .Last year , large insurers were hesitant to enter the new marketplace , concerned by conservatives ' political opposition as well as federal regulations that required that the plans be available to any individual regardless of age or health status .When the exchanges first launched in October 2013 , technology failures crippled the federal enrollment website , Healthcare.gov , and many websites run by individual states . But as the government fixed those problems , enrollment came in ahead of forecast .Now many insurers expect their Obamacare business to have profit margins of 2 percent to 3 percent within a few years , based on government forecasts for the market to grow to 13 million people in 2015 and 25 million by 2017 .Broussard said insurers may grapple with customer churn as consumers seek better prices as well as more technology problems as existing customers try to re-enroll either in the same plan or in a new plan for 2015 .Humana , which has about 700,000 members enrolled in Obamacare plans , has a large business providing medical benefits and prescription drug plans under the Medicare program for the elderly , and sees a risk posed by pricey new drugs expected to reach the U.S. market in the next few years .Insurers are already calling for a change in how new drugs are priced after paying more than they expected for Gilead Sciences Inc 's new $ 84,000 Hepatitis C treatment . New personalized treatments for cancer and an experimental class of cholesterol fighting drugs are seen inflating those costs further .`` We 've had a great trend over the last couple of years in healthcare cost staying flat or decreasing , '' Broussard said . `` If these drugs come out at the price they are , I think you are going to see a reversal of that .

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday said 7.3 million people were up to date on their monthly premiums for private health plans under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law as of Aug. 15 .Republicans have long sought the number of Obamacare enrollees who have paid premiums as potential evidence that the administration 's initial enrollment figures were exaggerated .The figure , which administration officials stressed was not an estimate of actual enrollment , could show that lower-income Obamacare enrollees are proving better than initially expected at retaining private health coverage acquired through new insurance marketplaces set up in all 50 states .`` We are encouraged by the number of consumers who paid their premiums , '' Marilyn Tavenner , a top U.S. healthcare official , said in testimony before a congressional oversight panel .The Department of Health and Human Services announced earlier this year that 8 million people had signed up for 2014 coverage during an open enrollment period that ended in April . Officials and independent experts speculated that 80 percent to 85 percent , or 6.4 million to 6.8 million people , would actually make premium payments .The 7.3 million figure would represent a 91 percent premium payment rate . It is also a larger number than the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office 's enrollment forecast of 6 million for the Obamacare marketplace .But HHS officials cautioned against comparisons with earlier estimates , saying marketplace enrollment fluctuates in time as people change jobs , marry or experience other life-changing events .The administration had no overall enrollment estimate but said the number would probably be higher than 7.3 million because of enrollees who might have made monthly payments after Aug. 15 .Thursday 's figure also did not include people who enrolled in a marketplace plan and either failed to pay their premiums or paid but then discontinued coverage , according to the administration .The administration released the data during a heated committee hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives , where Republican lawmakers criticized Tavenner about security issues surrounding HealthCare.gov , the online portal for a federal Obamacare marketplace that serves consumers in 36 states .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn )

NEW YORK — An unknown hacker or hackers broke into a computer server supporting the HealthCare.gov website through which consumers enroll in Obamacare health insurance , a government cybersecurity team discovered last week , apparently uploading malicious files .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , briefed key congressional staff on Thursday about the intrusions , the first of which occurred on July 8 , CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said .The malware uploaded to the server was designed to launch a distributed denial of service , or DDoS , attack against other websites , not to steal personal information , Albright said .In a DDoS , Internet-connected computers are so overwhelmed by malware attempting to communicate with their website that , unable to handle legitimate requests , they crash .`` Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information ; data was not transmitted outside the agency , and the website was not specifically targeted , '' Albright said . `` We have taken measures to further strengthen security . ''Albright said the attack would have no impact on the second open enrollment period for Obamacare , which begins on Nov. 15 .The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , and HHS leadership were notified of the attack , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .Representative Diane Black of Tennessee , a longtime Republican critic of Obamacare , criticized CMS for the breach , saying : `` Designing a secure website should have been a top priority for this administration . ''Republican Darrell Issa , chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said the committee would seek answers from CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing on Sept. 18 .A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , which helps investigate cyber attacks , said its Computer Emergency Readiness Team , or US-CERT , had forensically preserved the affected server and had identified and extracted the malware designed to launch a denial of service attack .US-CERT analysis indicated that only one server was involved . It was not running HealthCare.gov , but was instead used by programmers to test new code before it goes live .The test server was not supposed to be connected to the Internet , but somehow was . In addition , access to it was protected by a default password installed by the manufacturer , said Albright , who declined to say if that default was 1-2-3-4-5 or something equally breachable .Cybersecurity expert David Kennedy , chief executive of the information security firm TrustedSec LLC , said he was unconvinced this was the first successful hack on HealthCare.gov .`` There are fundamental flaws in how they 're coding the website and it 's going to take a long , long time to fix it , '' he told Reuters . `` It continues to be a really big glaring security hole .

To the Editor:Re âWhy I ( Still ) Support Obamacareâ ( column , Nov. 10 ) :Thomas L. Friedmanâs support for Obamacare on behalf of Americaâs work force is both appropriate and commendable . As well , it should be mentioned that our traditional system of employment-based health insurance , based as it is on the employersâ rolling those costs into the price of their products and services , is unsustainable .No other industrialized country does this , leaving our business at a disadvantage in a highly competitive field .The American auto industry , for example , at one point estimated that 10 to 12 percent of the price of its cars represented the cost of health insurance for its employees and retirees .To the degree that Obamacare offers alternative means of funding , business should be supportive as well .JAMES J. FLORIO Metuchen , N.J. , Nov. 10 , 2013The writer is a former Democratic governor of New Jersey .

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama 's top health adviser on Monday called for an end to partisan bickering over Obamacare , saying the public and businesses are sending a clear message to Washington that it is time to move on with implementing the law .`` The Affordable Care Act is clearly working , '' U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told a university audience in remarks that unveiled a new administration message about the successes of the healthcare reform law just as the midterm election campaign debate about its future intensifies .`` What I 've been hearing over and over ... ( is ) enough already with the back and forth . We just want to move forward , '' she said in her first major public address .`` We 're not here to fight last year 's battles , '' Burwell added . `` The Affordable Care Act is not about making a point . It 's about making progress . ''Burwell took over the health secretary job from Kathleen Sebelius in June as part of an administration effort to begin a new chapter for healthcare reform after four years of political and legal challenges from conservative foes .Officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) said the aim is to stress the affordability of Obamacare insurance , new access to medical services for the uninsured and the quality of coverage as the administration prepares for a new three-month open enrollment period beginning on Nov. 15 .The administration will also underscore studies and polling that suggest Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement has significantly reduced the number of uninsured Americans by subsidizing the cost of private insurance for lower-income people and expanding the Medicaid program for the poor in more than half of the 50 U.S. states .But a public outreach campaign , already under way to drive enrollment for 2015 coverage , will also coincide with the Oct. 1 anniversary of the disastrous rollout of Obamacare , a date Republicans are likely to mark with blistering rhetoric as the fall campaign for the Nov. 4 election gets fully under way .Obama 's Affordable Care Act remains unpopular with large segments of the voting public . In Reuters/Ipsos polling of 384 people over the first five days of September , 51 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Obama’s handling of healthcare reform , while 39 percent said they approved and 10 percent said they did not know . The poll has a margin of error of 5 percentage points .In early August , 57 percent of 1,599 respondents said they opposed the healthcare law , while 43 percent favored it . That poll had a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points .Analysts say the issue is not proving to be as big as expected with potential voters . But Republicans still hope public discontent will help them take control of the Senate and dismantle the legislation .Healthcare reform will be front and center later this week during a Republican-led House of Representatives oversight hearing at which top HHS and Internal Revenue Service officials are slated to testify .( Additional reporting by Gabriel Debenedetti ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )

To the Editor:âOn Health Exchanges , Premiums May Be Low , but Other Costs Can Be Highâ ( news article , Dec. 9 ) tells only part of the story .While it is true that there are policies on exchanges with lower premiums and higher deductibles , there are also policies with lower deductibles and somewhat higher premiums , all with different coverage , co-pays and coinsurance options .On the Massachusetts Health Connector exchange , I can choose from 93 plans offered by more than six insurers . I can select the plan that meets the coverage needs of my family at the lowest expected overall cost , considering premium , deductible , co-pays and coinsurance , with the doctors and hospitals I want .That is the beauty of Obamacare : Consumers can make choices that meet their individual needs .THOMAS O.

TO THE EDITOR:Re âObamacare , Retooledâ ( Economic View , Oct. 20 ) , in which Tyler Cowen described how he thought the Affordable Care Act might be revised in ways that both political parties could endorse:I stopped at this sentence , where Professor Cowen noted assumptions that each party would have to make if revisions were to work : âIâll also assume that Republicans will acknowledge that a feasible rewrite of the bill can not give the Democrats nothing.âAt that point , the column became a waste of time for me . After all , we have just come through a 16-day shutdown of government and a near-default because of the Republican Partyâs continued opposition to Obamacare . While many of that partyâs elected officials have acknowledged that this is not the time to defund or eliminate Obamacare , who among them has acknowledged the need for its continued existence ? Isnât their attitude the same as giving the Democrats ânothingâ ?MARK STACKHOUSEDRESHER , PA. , OCT. 20

OK , the plan is out . Basically , it splits the difference between the House and Senate bills , with a set of measures that can be passed through reconciliation . Igor Volsky has a nice table doing the comparison . Since the House bill is better than the Senate bill , and the Senate bill is much better than nothing , this should be a go .What I hear is that at this point the House is a bigger problem than the Senate . Pelosi — and Obama — have to drive home the following points : 1 . This is the last chance to do HCR for years to come , and America desperately needs this 2 . For their own sake , Democrats have to run on a record of having achieved something .I’m not in a position to do nose-counts , but I’m guardedly optimistic .











WASHINGTON — The explosive politics of health care have divided the nation , but America 's governors , Republicans and Democrats alike , suggest that President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul is here to stay .While governors from Connecticut to Louisiana sparred Sunday over how best to improve the nation 's economy , governors of both parties shared a far more pragmatic outlook on the controversial program known as `` Obamacare '' as millions of their constituents begin to be covered .`` We 're just trying to make the best of a bad situation , '' said Republican Gov . Terry Branstad of Iowa , who called the health care law `` unaffordable and unsustainable '' yet something he has to implement by law . `` We 're trying to make it work as best we can for the people of Iowa . ''As governors gathered in Washington this weekend , Democrats such as Maryland 's Martin O'Malley and Connecticut 's Dannel Malloy made pitches to raise the minimum wage , while Republicans such as Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal and Indiana 's Mike Pence called for more freedom from federal regulations , particularly those related to the health insurance overhaul .But governors from both parties say a full repeal of the law would be complicated at best , if not impossible , as states move forward with implementation and begin covering millions of people — both by expanding Medicaid rolls for lower-income residents or through state or federal exchanges that offer federal subsidies to those who qualify .Obama hosted most of the governors for a White House dinner Sunday night , calling for collaboration on the economy , education , climate change and health care in what he hopes will be `` a year of action . ''Republican opposition to the health care law is the centerpiece of the GOP 's political strategy ahead of the midterm elections . And to be sure , not every GOP leader embraced the inevitability of the law 's implementation .`` I do n't think that it 's so deeply entrenched that it ca n't be repealed , '' Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal said . `` But I do think , as we argue for repeal , we have to show folks what you replace it with . ''Despite a troubled rollout , nearly 3.3 million people have signed up through Feb. 1 for health care coverage under the law . The White House reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in January alone . It remains unclear whether the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of March , but it still expects several million enrollees by then .A recent Associated Press analysis found that sign-ups in six Republican-led states — Florida , Idaho , Maine , Michigan , North Carolina and Wisconsin — were on pace to match or exceed figures the states had initially projected .Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder is among several Republicans who expanded his state 's Medicaid laws .`` The whole dialogue on the Affordable Care Act is about people fighting , causing gridlock and a mess , instead of working on something important like wellness , '' Snyder said , adding that he still has `` a lot of issues '' with the overhaul . `` But it is the law , so I 'm trying to work in that context . ''Vermont Gov . Peter Shumlin , who leads the Democratic Governors Association , said governors spent about half of their private lunch session Saturday discussing the health care law and the tone was much different than in past years .`` Before the election , it felt like a cockfight , '' Shumlin said , describing the debate over the law during the 2012 campaign . `` Down there we were talking about ways we could cooperate . ''`` There 's no doubt in my mind that the Republicans have accepted that as millions of people sign up for it and finally get the health care they have been dreaming of for their families , nobody 's going to take that away , '' Shumlin said .Democrats and Republicans alike complained about major problems with the Medicaid eligibility data that they are receiving from federal exchanges . The 36 states in the federal exchange have noted often incomplete data with the Medicaid information they are receiving .Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Corbett , a Republican who is among his party 's most vulnerable incumbents in the fall election , said he 's working to expand his state 's Medicaid program , but the process had been cumbersome and difficult . He said it still remained unclear , from a fiscal standpoint , if the health care law would be functioning in two years .`` There are a lot more unknowns than there are knowns , '' Corbett said .Oklahoma Gov . Mary Fallin , a Republican , said many governors still have concerns about the program , but outright repeal would be `` complicated . ''Republican campaign officials , meanwhile , plan to make the health care law the overwhelming focus of the coming midterm elections .From coast to coast , conservatives are attacking Democrats who supported the overhaul , seizing on problems with the program 's website and news that some Americans were forced to change insurers once the law took effect . The conservative group Americans For Prosperity has spent more than $ 20 million on anti-Obamacare television ads in several key states since last August .While the stakes are high for parties battling over control of the House and Senate , there are also 36 elections for governor , most of them for jobs currently held by Republicans . The coming elections also offer prospective 2016 presidential candidates an opportunity to boost their political standing .GOP senators like Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida have been vocal critics of the health care law . Cruz mounted a 21-hour Senate speech against Obama 's health law and was tied to the partial government shutdown , while Rubio was an early proponent of defunding the health law , although he distanced himself from the shutdown .New Hampshire Gov . Maggie Hassan , a first-term Democrat up for re-election in November , said her state would soon expand its Medicaid program to cover 50,000 uninsured residents .`` Overall , I 'm very disappointed with the early implementation and rollout , '' she said . `` But I think we are making progress . ''



On Monday , the Supreme Court will begin three days of arguments over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act . The act is often called ''Obamacare , '' primarily by Republicans , as a term of disdain . Democrats have tried to limit the term 's use to reshape perceptions , but that has been a tough sell . Grant Barrett , a vice president for the American Dialect Society , says it is almost impossible to persuade people to discontinue the use of a political word . ''It 's an invitation to have your heart broken . You forbid it , and they start writing it on the bathroom stalls .

RALEIGH , N.C. — North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan has her Republican opponent right where she wants him geographically — and , therefore , politically .Thom Tillis is stuck at the state capitol trying to resolve a budget quarrel as speaker of the North Carolina House . It 's a spot that helps Hagan emphasize Tillis ' role leading a Republican-controlled state government that Democrats contend has gone overboard with conservative zeal by restricting access to abortion and the voting booth while cutting corporate taxes and slashing spending on schools .If Tillis is worried by Hagan 's portrayal , he does n't show it . Drinking coffee this past week from a hand-grenade-shaped mug in his no-frills legislative office , he 's got his own message in his campaign to take Hagan 's Senate seat . `` Obamacare , '' he said , `` continues to be a big problem . ''Similar themes are playing out in other crucial Senate races , as voters have four months to decide which party will control the chamber in the final two years of Barack Obama 's presidency . For Republicans , it 's all about tying Democrats to Obama — especially to a health care law that remains unpopular with many Americans . And for Democrats , the election is about just about anything else , especially if they can steer attention away from Washington and federal matters .It 's a political strategy that sometimes gives the campaigns an inside-out feel , with veteran senators running as if they were first-timers without a Washington resume to defend or tout .Democrat Mark Pryor has represented Arkansas in the Senate for two terms , yet one of his TV ads begins with a man saying , `` I remember when Pryor was attorney general . '' A woman adds that he pursued `` scam artists that were ripping off seniors . ''Pryor was state attorney general more than a decade ago , and for just four years , compared to his nearly dozen in the Senate . His harkening back to that time points to his desire to make the election a choice between a famous name in Arkansas state politics and first-term Rep. Tom Cotton , a Republican whom many view as less personable and engaging than Pryor .The GOP strategy , in return , is straightforward . One TV ad has a young girl spelling Pryor 's name as O-B-A-M-A .Traditionally emphasized by first-time campaigners , personal biographies are central to several other Democrats ' re-election campaigns . Alaska Sen. Mark Begich has aired a TV ad with footage of him as a boy of about 10 , when his father , Rep. Nick Begich , died in a plane crash . `` Mark is clearly his father 's son , '' says the narrator , Begich 's wife , Deborah Bonito .And after 18 years in the Senate , Democrat Mary Landrieu is arguably the most accomplished member of her famous Louisiana political family . Still , she has aired an ad in which her father — former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu — says affectionately : `` When you have nine children , you 're bound to have one who 's hard-headed . ''Some Democrats might say the same about the GOP 's strategy of bashing `` Obamacare '' now that the Affordable Care Act is 4 years old . Not Tillis , who says Obama and Hagan exaggerated the extent to which people could keep their doctors and insurance plans . He calls it `` the greatest example of a promise not kept . ''He 's getting help with the message from Crossroads GPS , the political group run in part by Republican strategist Karl Rove , which is spending more than $ 3.5 million on television ads in North Carolina this summer . The group 's latest ad attacking Hagan asks whether voters know she `` cast the deciding vote for Obamacare . ''`` The idea that this will be anything less than a referendum on Obamacare is wishful thinking , '' said Rep. Patrick McHenry , R-N.C .The amount spent on the Hagan-Tillis race — about $ 17 million and climbing — is among the nation 's highest . It comes in a state that few can rival for political change in recent years , as Republicans ended a century of frustration by winning control of both legislative chambers and the governor 's office in 2012 .What came next is a `` conservative revolution '' that Tillis said he 's proud of leading . Hagan and her fellow Democrats argue the Republicans went too far in a state so closely divided politically that Obama carried it in 2008 and lost it four years later . They believe a bump in teacher pay that Tillis promises lawmakers will enact this summer wo n't erase North Carolinians ' memories of the deep cuts to education that Republicans passed last year .That approach , said Rep. David Price , D-N.C. , is Hagan 's best chance to focus November voters ' attention on something other than Obama . Her strategy `` is exactly what she should do , '' Price said , because Tillis `` has got that hung right around his neck . ''Hagan , meanwhile , points to achievements close to home . They include her push to provide medical care to military families exposed to tainted water for decades at Camp Lejeune , the giant Marine Corps base in eastern North Carolina .`` Kay Hagan , '' said veteran North Carolina GOP strategist Paul Shumaker , `` is hoping the sins of Raleigh are much bigger than the sins of Washington . ''

The insurance marketplaces that form the centerpiece of President Obamaâs health care law are scheduled to open on Tuesday , a watershed moment for the Obama administration , but also a crucial turning point for millions of Americans who will finally get the chance to square the lawâs lofty ambitions with their own personal needs .While some people desperate for coverage will need no persuading to sign up , for others the decision will amount to a series of complicated calculations that would challenge an accounting whiz , let alone an ordinary human : Are the new plans less expensive or more generous than existing ones ? How do premiums and out-of-pocket costs compare ? Are the networks of doctors and hospitals the most desirable ? Who qualifies for how much of a subsidy , and what is the tax penalty for a miscalculation ?How millions of people answer these questions over the next six months will be vital to determining whether the Affordable Care Act lives up to its name and its ambitious goal of helping more people buy the coverage they need .Much is at stake for insurers as well : they must attract enough healthy people to pay for the care of sicker patients and price their offerings to keep premiums low enough to be competitive but high enough to be sustainable .Health insurance âis a very complex product , â said Lynn Quincy , a senior health policy analyst for Consumers Union in Washington . âIt is going to be more complex this time around because things are changing , and people are confused about the changes.âAs the state insurance exchanges are set to open , we talked to people around the country who will be among the first to give them a test drive . For some , the law could provide welcome relief from mounting medical bills ; for others , a break from rising premiums . Still others must decide whether insurance is right for them at all .Mitchell McGovern works part time and has no health insurance .Young and HealthyMitchell McGovern , 26 , lives in Brooklyn and works as a part-time sales associate at a Crate and Barrel store in Manhattan . He earns about $ 15,000 a year and does not have health insurance of any kind .A bout with pneumonia in January sent him to the doctorâs office , which cost him $ 75 , and $ 150 for medication . Mr. McGovern said he would love to buy health insurance â and he was mindful that the law requires him to do so â but only if it cost him less than $ 100 a month . âI live paycheck to paycheck , â he explained .Mr. McGovern is exactly the sort of person the Obama administration needs to enroll in the new insurance marketplaces if the federal health care law is to succeed â young , healthy people who until now have not been covered by insurance , either because they couldnât afford it or because it wasnât a priority . If a critical mass of these people doesnât enroll â the federal government hopes to sign up about 2.7 million of them â the premiums for plans offered on the exchanges could skyrocket and cause the market to fail as fewer and fewer people take part .Mr. McGovernâs current income will probably qualify him , just barely , for Medicaid in New York State . But for Mr. McGovern and others like him , predicting how much he will make even a few months from now is hard , and he may end up qualifying instead for tax-credit subsidies in the state marketplace . Mr. McGovern recently moved to New York from California and sees his job at Crate and Barrel as a foothold until he finds work that would offer more money and perhaps coverage paid largely by the employer .His uncertain financial situation is typical of the population most likely to consider the insurance marketplaces , said Ceci Connolly , managing director of the Health Research Institute at PricewaterhouseCoopers . Only about 51 percent will have full-time jobs , with a median annual income of about $ 21,700 , according to an analysis by her firm based on government data like the census . She said 38 percent of the people expected to enroll will end up shuttling several times between Medicaid and the marketplaces over the next four years .



( Reuters ) - Health insurance premiums for low-cost Obamacare plans in 16 U.S. cities will fall slightly in 2015 as competition helps drives down price for the new subsidized individual health plans , according to a study Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation .The Kaiser analysis found that the premiums for the second lowest cost `` silver '' tier plan , upon which government tax credit subsidies are based , will fall compared with 2014 prices by an average of 0.8 percent in 7 of 16 major cities .If the trend holds across the country , the study said , the lower benchmark premium could mean that the government subsidies are less overall and there are more tax savings .Private insurers began selling new health insurance plans for individuals last year for coverage starting in 2014 . Plans for 2015 insurance coverage will be up for sale starting on Nov. 15 , 2014 when enrollment opens .Kaiser found that among the biggest changes in pricing were a decline on average of more than 15 percent in Denver to $ 211 , of 11 percent in Providence , Rhode Island to $ 260 and of nearly 10 percent in Seattle to $ 254 .In Nashville , Tennessee , the silver premium price will rise 8.7 percent to $ 205 , while Burlington , Vermont will have a 6.6 percent rise to $ 440 and Portland , Oregon will go up 6 percent to $ 213 , the study said . The premiums exclude income-based government subsidies .Including these tax credits , the average in the 16 cities would be a monthly premium of $ 208 versus $ 209 a year earlier , the study found .Premiums for the lowest tier plan , bronze , are increasing an average of 3.3 percent in 2015 , the study found .Kaiser looked at plan premiums before and after federal tax credits for a 40-year old single adult who is a non-smoker and earns $ 30,000 per year .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; Editing by Grant McCool )

The Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare , goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year , and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide . There will be an administrative âtrain wreck , â weâre told ; consumers will face a terrible shock . Republicans , one hears , are already counting on the lawâs troubles to give them a big electoral advantage .No doubt there will be problems , as there are with any large new government initiative , and in this case , we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform . Yet important new evidence â especially from California , the lawâs most important test case â suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success .Before I can explain what the news means , I need to make a crucial point : Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform , not in a political sense ( although it was originally a Republican proposal ) but in terms of leaving most peopleâs health care unaffected . Americans who receive health insurance from their employers , Medicare or Medicaid â which is to say , the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all â will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect .There are , however , millions of Americans who donât receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs . They can get insurance only by buying it on their own , and many of them are effectively shut out of that market . In some states , like California , insurers reject applicants with past medical problems . In others , like New York , insurers canât reject applicants , and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history ( âcommunity ratingâ ) ; unfortunately , this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up , while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured .Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach . First , community rating everywhere â no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions . Second , the âmandateâ â you must buy insurance even if youâre currently healthy . Third , subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes .Massachusetts has had essentially this system since 2006 ; as a result , nearly all residents have health insurance , and the program remains very popular . So we know that Obamacare â or , as some of us call it , ObamaRomneyCare â can work .Skeptics argued , however , that Massachusetts was special : it had relatively few uninsured residents even before the reform , and it already had community rating . What would happen elsewhere ? In particular , what would happen in California , where more than a fifth of the nonelderly population is uninsured , and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated ? Would there be âsticker shockâ as the price of individual policies soared ?Well , the California bids are in â that is , insurers have submitted the prices at which they are willing to offer coverage on the stateâs newly created Obamacare exchange . And the prices , it turns out , are surprisingly low . A handful of healthy people may find themselves paying more for coverage , but it looks as if Obamacareâs first year in California is going to be an overwhelmingly positive experience .What can still go wrong ? Well , Obamacare is a complicated program , basically because simpler options , like Medicare for all , werenât considered politically feasible . So there will probably be a lot of administrative confusion as the law goes into effect , again especially in states where Republicans have been doing their best to sabotage the process .Also , some people are too poor to afford coverage even with the subsidies . These Americans were supposed to be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid , but in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion , such unfortunates will be left out in the cold .Still , hereâs what it seems is about to happen : millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage , and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes . Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all . And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it , the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious .So yes , it does look as if thereâs an Obamacare shock coming : the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can , strange to say , end up helping a lot of people â especially when government officials actually try to make it work .

WASHINGTON — Giving another chance to a key part of the Obamacare health law , a U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out a decision it made in July that threatened to limit the availability of federal health insurance subsidies for millions of people .The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed to rehear the question of whether the subsidies should be available in all 50 states or only in some . The court will hear new oral arguments on Dec. 17 .The U.S. Justice Department had asked for the rehearing after a three-judge panel on the court ruled against the Obama administration on the legality of the subsidies , which have been challenged by conservatives who object to the 2010 healthcare law .A panel of up to 13 judges will reconsider the case , improving the administration 's odds of a more favorable outcome because Democratic appointees make up a majority of the court , legal experts said .A senior White House official welcomed the court 's action , saying it was `` an important and welcome next step . ''The court 's announcement also delayed possible U.S. Supreme Court consideration of the issue .Obamacare , the most sweeping overhaul of the healthcare system in decades and the signature domestic accomplishment of President Barack Obama 's first term , set up health insurance exchanges and tax-credit subsidies to help people afford insurance premiums .The law is still a target of criticism by Republicans .Sam Kazman , general counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , which is funding the litigation against Obamacare , said that ultimately the Supreme Court `` is the only court that can resolve this issue in the quick and final manner that the country deserves . ''The plaintiffs say that , based on the language in the law , the subsidies may only be paid in states that have their own online health insurance exchanges . A total of 36 states do not have exchanges of their own .Five million people could be affected , analysts have estimated , if the administration loses the legal fight and subsidies disappear from the federal marketplaces that have been set up in states that did not create their own exchanges .The decision to rehear the case was made by the court 's 11 active judges . Two senior judges who were part of the original three-judge panel are also likely to participate in the rehearing . One is a Republican appointee and one a Democratic appointee .The three-judge panel that ruled in July was split 2-1 , with two Republican appointees in the majority .In a similar case involving Obamacare subsidies , the 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond , Virginia , ruled in favor of the Obama administration in July . The plaintiffs in that case have already sought immediate U.S. Supreme Court review of that ruling .The case before the Washington court is Halbig v. Burwell , U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , No . 14-5018 .( Editing by Doina Chiacu , Kevin Drawbaugh , Bernadette Baum and Paul Simao )

Keep in mind that , according to the Milliman Medical Index , the total medical costs for a typical U.S. family with private employer-based insurance , averaged over some 10 million , came to $ 19,500 ( including the employer-paid premium contribution , the employee’s contribution and out-of-pocket spending ) .That total may have some fat in it for unnecessary stuff , but I wonder how much it can be , given the high health-spending concentration among a few very sick patients and given our cultural trait , especially among conservatives , never to rule out any heroic procedures over issues of cost-effectiveness .My concern is that , if insurers in the individual market are free to base their premiums on the health status of individual applicants , a family in less-than-good health might find it very hard to get adequate health-insurance coverage for $ 8,000 , unless very high deductibles and tight upper limits on this or that procedure make a mockery of the term “insurance.”Mr. Goodman replied to my comment:I believe we can have credits of $ 2,500 for adults and $ 8,000 for a family of four .

The fact is that the government is required to cover much higher actuarial risks than is the private sector .

As long as I’m talking about alternative health care bills , it’s worth lingering over some of the latest news about the bill we actually got . First , the C.B.O . has released a new estimate of how much additional discretionary spending — on implementation costs , further subsidies for new and existing programs , etc . — health care reform is likely to generate over the first 10 years . The total comes to $ 115 billion above and beyond the official price tag , a sum that would almost wipe out the bill’s projected deficit savings in the first decade .Keep in mind that — as Ezra Klein points out — this is spending that Congress will need to appropriate anew every year , and since we’re ( theoretically ) operating under a domestic spending freeze , it will ( theoretically ) all have to be offset with cuts elsewhere , or else be voted down . So that $ 115 billion estimate might not be quite as bad as it sounds . But given how hard it is to find offsets and/or kill off existing programs , the C.B.O . estimate certainly isn’t good news for America’s finances .Nor is the news that Reihan Salam took note of last week , which bears on one of the potential fiscal time bombs embedded in reform — namely , the possibility that far more companies will offload their employees into the new government-run exchanges than the C.B.O.’s official estimate predicts . There’s a penalty for dropping coverage , but for many employers the move would end up saving them ( and their workers ) a lot of money , the penalty notwithstanding . And if enough decide to take advantage , the government could find itself spending billions more in subsidies than the C.B.O.’s projections anticipate , driving health care reform deep into the red .Now a Fortune piece offers evidence that a number of large employers are considering doing exactly that . It comes courtesy of Henry Waxman , who helpfully demanded that AT & T , Verizon , Caterpillar and Deere turn over internal documents justifying their post-reform writedowns . These documents , it turns out , included internal memos weighing the pros and cons of dropping coverage:AT & T produced a PowerPoint slide entitled “Medical Cost Versus No Coverage Penalty.” A document prepared for Verizon by consulting firm Hewitt Resources stated , “Even though the proposed assessments [ on companies that do not provide health care ] are material , they are modest when compared to the average cost of health care , ” and that to avoid costs and regulations , “employers may consider exiting the health care market and send employees to the Exchanges.” ( Under the new bill , employees who lose their coverage will purchase health care through state-run exchanges . )Kenneth Huhn , vice president of labor relations at Deere , said in an internal email that his company should look at the alternatives to providing health benefits , which “would amount to denying coverage and just paying the penalty , ” and that he felt he already had the ability to make this change under his company’s labor agreement . Caterpillar felt it would have to give “serious consideration” to the penalty option .It’s these analyses — which show it’s a lot cheaper to “pay” than to “play” — that threaten to overthrow the traditional architecture of health care .Of course that traditional employer-based architecture is a mess anyway , so there’s a sense in which the more people who shift on to the exchanges the better . The problem is figuring out how to pay for it . In an ideal world , Washington would respond to a bigger-than-anticipated shift by slashing the subsidies and deregulating the exchanges , until you ended up with a system where the federal government was effectively paying for universal catastrophic coverage , rather than trying to subsidize comprehensive insurance . ( The end result would be something that looked a bit like Wyden-Bennett , and a bit like Judd Gregg’s stillborn compromise . )But in a less-than-ideal world , the Fortune piece notes , the fiscal picture will get very ugly very quickly:What does it mean for health care reform if the employer-sponsored regime collapses ? By Fortune’s reckoning , each person who’s dropped would cost the government an average of around $ 2,100 after deducting the extra taxes collected on their additional pay . So if 50 % of people covered by company plans get dumped , federal health care costs will rise by $ 160 billion a year in 2016 , in addition to the $ 93 billion in subsidies already forecast by the CBO .I’ll leave the last word to The New Yorker’s John Cassidy , discussing just this problem with the current reform package : “At that point , if it comes , politicians of both parties will be back close to where they began : searching for health-care reform that provides adequate coverage for all at a cost the country can afford . What would such a system look like ? That is a topic for another post , but I don’t think it would look much like Romney-ObamaCare.”

So far , nearly all of the left-of-center responses to the latest C.B.O . projections on Obamacare and workforce participation have emphasized the upside of the downward trend — the fact that what we’re seeing is just the end of job lock in action , which gives parents the freedom to cut their hours , near-retirees the chance to stop working a job they hate a little early , and so on down a sympathetic list . “If Obamacare really does cause millions of people to voluntarily leave full-time employment , ” Matt Yglesias writes in a representative piece , “that shows us how much avoidable suffering the earlier system was causing , ” and you can find roughly similar arguments from Jonathan Cohn , Jonathan Chait , and others too numerous to name .The issue that I’d really like to see liberals reckon with comes from this post by Tyler Cowen , which I’ll quote at length:In two papers , one of which is quite recent , and does not stem from the Heritage Foundation , [ Alan ] Krueger shows rather convincingly that the unemployed maintain reservation wages which are simply too high . They would be better off lowering those wages , being more realistic , accepting work , and getting back on their feet again . In other settings ( not considered by Krueger ) , other workers seem to be too slow to move to new areas for new jobs , given the costs of being unemployed long-term .… OK , given all that , when those workers , hit by negative shocks , do not rush to go back to work at lower reservation wages , we then read a portrait of hysteresis , despair , and soul-crushing joblessness , a psychic swamp so difficult to escape that even summoning up the strength to go back to work may be difficult .In other words , would-be workers irrationally undervalue the benefits of having a job and they also underestimate the costs of remaining unemployed .Now let’s switch settings . A benefit shock comes along , positive for many people , and it induces many of them to work less or not work at all . How happy should we be ? And here I mean happy at the margin , due to their change in employment decision .People , it is rather difficult to have it here both ways . I guess it is possible that workers are irrational in changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative dollar wage opportunities , but rational when changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative benefit opportunities . It really is possible . But are any of you actually arguing that or holding some deep-seated reason for believing in that difference , other than perhaps the reason this post might have induced you to come up with ? No , I see one assumption about a destructive choice in one context and the opposing assumption about a beneficial choice in the other context , without much regard for the tension or contradiction between those two assumptions … .… A simpler possibility is that people undervalue the long-term benefits of having a job and thus in both settings the contraction in employment is a quite negative outcome . That is then very bad news for ACA , if only in expected value terms .Here is how I would frame the issue : There are specific classes of people who plainly benefit , in fairly uncomplicated ways , from benefits that provide an incentive to work less , or leave a job outright . The obvious examples are the ones that liberals keep invoking : Parents of young children ( for whom the family-friendly tax overhaul that conservative reformers like to tout would presumably have a similar effect ) , and people with a disability or chronic medical condition that makes work a simple misery .But there also lots of people who emphatically do not benefit from being given an incentive to either detach from the workforce or ( if they’re already unemployed or underemployed ) remain detached rather than taking a lower-paying job . And given the current economic landscape , especially — in which persistently high unemployment coexists with a growing population of workers too discouraged to even look for work — the size and scope of a work-discouraging effect matters a great deal : The bigger the effect , the more likely that the people dropping out aren’t just , say , parents cutting hours to spend more time at home while the other spouse works full time , but people we should want to be attached to the workforce , for their own long-term good and the good of the economy as well .Which is why it’s appropriate that the new C.B.O . projection of 2 million to 2.5 million job-equivalents disappearing has inspired more disquiet and debate than the old projection of 500,000-900,000 … because it’s a sign , however provisional , that the costs of Obamacare’s workforce effects might exceed the benefits . I don’t see liberals reckoning seriously with that possibility , and I think they really should .

Or hostile Republicans and timid Democrats could destroy the promise .Which will it be ?KATHY HEGGEMEIER Portsmouth , Va. , Nov. 7 , 2013ÂTo the Editor:Re âThis Is Why We Need Obamacare , â by Nicholas D.

But did we need the total morass of this legislation to institute these positive changes ?President Obama would have received bipartisan support if these changes were presented in a more piecemeal fashion . As an example , it is inconceivable that Republicans would have voted against those changes allowing pre-existing conditions to be covered in Obamacare . Instead , the president chose to pursue this complicated piece of legislation without getting a single Republican vote .In addition , we now know the president was wrong when he said people would be able to keep their existing insurance plans .We are a very diverse society , and people should be able to select whatever insurance is right for them . And canât we figure out a more effective and efficient way to help those people in need ?THEODORE BRINDISI Hazlet , N.J. , Nov. 4 , 2013ÂTo the Editor:Nicholas D.

It will no doubt require tweaking . But it makes that first , all-important leap toward recovery from our sickness of inertia and tolerance for the status quo .I am somewhat amused that our longstanding free-market health care system resulted in such poor quality and high costs .

Some commenters have asked a good question , albeit in a belligerent tone : how does the Ryan plan differ from the Affordable Care Act ? After all , in both plans people are supposed to buy coverage from private insurers , with a subsidy from the government .Well , the answer is that the ACA is specifically designed to ensure that insurance is affordable , whereas Ryancare just hands out vouchers and washes its hands . Specifically , the ACA subsidy system ( pdf ) sets a maximum percentage of income that families are expected to pay for insurance , on a sliding scale that rises with income . To the extent that the actual cost of a minimum acceptable policy exceeds that percentage of income , subsidies make up the difference .Ryancare , by contrast , provides a fixed sum — end of story . And because this fixed sum would not grow with rising health care costs , it’s almost guaranteed to fall far short of the actual cost of insurance .This is also why Ryancare is NOT premium support ; it’s a voucher system . No matter how much they say it isn’t , that’s exactly what it is .

Image taken down by requestI suggested yesterday that we’re probably heading for a turning point in the health reform discussion . Conservatives are operating on the assumption that it’s an irredeemable disaster that they can ride all the way to 2016 ; but the facts on the ground are getting better by the day , and Obamacare will turn into a Benghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about .And it’s already starting to happen .White House officials are sounding increasingly upbeat . They could be deluded or spinning ; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly .Meanwhile , media coverage is shifting fast . It’s still mostly trying for equivalence — each positive story of people being helped matched by a negative story of people hurt . But the stories don’t actually match up at all .Small example : earlier today I found myself trapped in a place with CNN on in the background , showing a fair-and-balanced account of losers and winners . First , the loser : a guy who admits that Obamacare has gotten him a plan cheaper than the insurance he had , but who has found that his current allergist is off-network . Annoying , no doubt ; but there are other allergists , and this particular one probably didn’t help the case by saying that he’s thinking of refusing to take Medicare patients , too .And in any case , insurance with restricted networks is hardly something new to Obamacare .Then , the winners : a couple with no insurance at all , because her premium would have been prohibitive and he has a preexisting condition that won’t let him buy any kind of insurance at all — but now both covered , at a very affordable price , by Covered California .I don’t know about you , but these don’t sound to me like equivalent stories .At this rate , the whole horrors-of-Obamacare meme will be gone in weeks , not months . But the GOP echo chamber won’t be able to let it go .



WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department will appeal to the full District of Columbia circuit court a ruling that threw out a key aspect of President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul , a spokeswoman for the agency said on Tuesday .In a statement , department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said the agency believes the ruling on subsidies is incorrect and inconsistent with Congressional intent .( Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha ; Editing by Jim Loney )

Suppose that healthcare.gov isn’t fixed by the end of next month . How bad is it for Obamacare ? Would the program be doomed ?No , says Jonathan Cohn , because there are two layers of protection against poor signup . First , there is a system of cross-subsidies to insurance companies that was intended to prevent companies from surreptitiously gaining an advantage by only signing up healthy people ( hey , our policy is available to anyone — but you have to sign up in our sixth-floor walkup office . ) As it turns out , this system would end up compensating insurance companies in general if the risk pool is worse than expected . Second , the subsidies to individuals are designed to hold health costs down to 8 percent of income , which means that they will rise if costs are higher than expected .Neither of these would be a good thing , since they would increase the budget cost , but they do mean that Obamacare’s survival probably isn’t on the line .Actually , the biggest reason Obama and co. should be anxious to fix these things now , I’d argue , isn’t the fate of the program itself , which can survive even large early wobbles , but the midterm elections . If Obamacare is fixed , Republicans will be in the position of attacking a program that is benefiting millions of Americans ; if it isn’t , they can still run against the legend , not the fact .So a lot is riding on fixing the technological botch — but not in quite the way people imagine .













“… Generations of conservatives have complained that the so-called mainstream media have been biased against them . Well , get ready , Republicans , for déjà vu all over again . The coverage through November likely will highlight the most extreme attacks on the President and his law and spotlight stories of real Americans whose lives have been improved by access to health care … The louder Republicans yell , the more they will be characterized and caricatured as sore losers infuriated by the first major delivery of candidate Obama’s promise of “change.” … But fighting back against a supposedly hostile press is old hat for the GOP . A far greater challenge will come from a new quarter . Large segments of the American business community are going to present a formidable ally for Obamacare , either with outspoken support or notable silence . From businesses that have been crushed by rising health care costs , to pharmaceutical companies cleverly co-opted by the White House early on in the process , to the doctors’ organizations ( including the American Medical Association ) that endorsed the final product , to , yes , even the vilified insurance companies — none of these entities are going to join the charge to reverse the new reality of U.S. health care , and many will make it clear that they are resigned to or actually in favor of the apparently inevitable conclusion.”— Mark Halperin , “Can the G.O.P . Succeed by Running Against Health Care ? ”





I haven’t been writing about the healthcare.gov thing , for the simple reason that I have nothing to say . What’s going on isn’t a policy question : we know from the states with working exchanges ( including California ) that the underlying structure of the law is workable . Instead , it’s about an implementation botch , which is an incredible mess , and reflects very badly on Obama . But the future of the reform depends not on policy per se but on whether the IT issues can be fixed well enough soon enough , a subject on which I have zero expertise .Of course , that hasn’t stopped other people from breathlessly commenting on every twist and turn in the polls , every meaningless vote in the House , and so on . Hey , it’s a living .But at this point there’s enough information coming in to make semi-educated guesses — and it looks to me as if this thing is probably going to stumble through to the finish line . State-run enrollments are mostly going pretty well ; Medicaid expansion is going very well ( and it’s expanding even in states that have rejected the expansion , because more people are learning they’re eligible . ) And healthcare.gov , while still pretty bad , is starting to look as if it will be good enough in a few weeks for large numbers of people to sign up , either through the exchanges or directly with insurers .If all this is right , by the time open enrollment ends in March , millions of previously uninsured Americans will in fact have received coverage under the law , and reform will be irreversible . Obama personally may never recover his reputation ; Democratic hopes of a wave election in 2014 are probably gone , although you never know . But anyone counting on Obamacare to collapse is probably making a very bad bet .

Mike Konczal says most of what needs to be said about the underlying sources of Obamacare’s complexity , which in turn set the stage for the current tech problems . Basically , Obamacare isn’t complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated : neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure . It’s complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable .It’s been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device , a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer , but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing . This doesn’t make it unworkable : state exchanges are working , and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in . But it did make a botched rollout much more likely .So Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems aren’t revealing problems with the idea of social insurance ; they’re revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix , when they serve little useful purpose .So does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing ? No . Single-payer wasn’t going to happen — partly because of the insurance lobby’s power , partly because voters wouldn’t have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown . Yes , Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge , but if that’s what it took to cover the uninsured , so be it .And although the botched rollout is infuriating — count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that , not trying to cover for the botch — the odds remain high that this will work , and make America a much better place .

This morning I talked to someone who successfully signed up for Obamacare — with great difficulty , but she did succeed in the end . Since New Jersey is one of the states that defaulted to a fed-run exchange , this shows that people are starting to trickle through . I know , one example — but the plural of anecdote is data .Oh , and she was very happy with the low cost .Obviously they messed up the programming big time , which is kind of a shock . But this will get fixed , and Republicans believing that they’re going to be able to run against the program a year from now are going to do about as well as they did in believing that they could use a shutdown to defund the program .

If House Republicans want to fray the Affordable Care Act on the eve of its implementation , defunding it won’t work . They’d be better off stripping or delaying the individual mandate .That’s the conclusion of two recent studies that speak to one of the many moving pieces in this fall’s vicious budget debate .House Republicans last week passed a bill that would keep on financing the federal government , but not the Affordable Care Act . Specifically , the bill orders : “Notwithstanding any other provision of law , no federal funds shall be made available to carry out any provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” or a related law . It also retracts the “entitlement to benefits” — that is , the Medicaid expansion — in the law .If the Senate , with a Democratic majority , passed the bill from the Republican-controlled House as is , the law would be shot . There would be no federal money for the state exchanges , or to cover low-income adults in Medicaid . But there’s no way the Senate would pass the House bill . Even if it did , President Obama has vowed a veto .Rather , any defunding would be temporary , because of a government shutdown . On the day the exchanges were due to open , much of the federal government would go offline , including a big portion of the Health and Human Services Department that is running the coverage expansion . But legislative inaction can not gut Obamacare in the way that legislative action could . During a shutdown , implementation would “substantially” continue .That’s according to a Congressional Research Service report prepared for Senator Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican . In no small part , the reason is that much of the Affordable Care Act’s financing comes from mandatory spending , rather than discretionary spending , and a continuing resolution concerns only the latter . Moreover , some of the law’s money comes from multiyear or “no-year” discretionary funds that do not get wrapped up in the continuing-resolution process either . The Health and Human Services Department says its reform implementation fund would not get touched by a lapse in appropriations .That is not to say that a shutdown , especially a long one , would not throw a wrench in health care reform or other programs financed with mandatory money . The Congressional Research Service report , for instance , looks at what happened to Medicare during the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 . It continued to pay doctors and hospitals . But its financing for its claims-processing vendors came from the discretionary budget . During the shutdown , those vendors kept working with only the expectation that they would get paid later . And during a long shutdown , “claims payments might cease as vendors ran out of cash to cover their operating costs , ” the research service report says .Temporary defunding probably would not do much . But Congress could substantially mar the law by stripping or delaying the tax penalties on Americans who decline to buy insurance — the so-called “individual mandate.” And it is one tactic that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is mulling .A new Urban Institute study explains why . Using Congressional Budget Office figures , it shows that delaying the individual mandate for a year would reduce coverage by about 11 million people in 2014 . That would save the government some money . However , the effect on the health insurance marketplace might be profound . Many young and healthy people would decline to buy insurance coverage , with no penalty . The pool of the insured would be relatively sicker . Insurers would be forced to increase rates , as the healthy would do less to cross-subsidize the ill . Premiums would shoot up .Here’s the institute on the multibillion-dollar problems that might create:There is significant risk that low exchange enrollment in the first year due to the lack of a mandate could begin an adverse selection cycle which would make it difficult to establish viable risk pools in the exchange in future years . While the Urban Institute estimated that premiums without the mandate could be up to 24 percent higher than with the mandate , that analysis assumed fully effective risk adjustment across the exchange and nonexchange markets . Less effective risk adjustment could lead to even higher premiums in the exchange without the mandate and could dissuade insurers from participating in the new markets ; this could then further dissuade healthier individuals with current nongroup coverage from entering the exchanges , exacerbating the effect in the following years .In short , even a one-year delay in the mandate might cause cost problems throughout the insurance market — and from the perspective of the law’s supporters , that might be a lot worse than hassles related to a temporary shutdown .
