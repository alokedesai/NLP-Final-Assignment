A large majority of Americans say they like the insurance coverage they obtained through government exchanges , which were set up by the Affordable Care Act .Via PoliticoWith the second round of Obamacare enrollment set to begin on Saturday , 71 percent said their coverage through the exchanges was good or excellent , according to a Gallup poll released Friday . Another 19 percent said the coverage was fair , while 9 percent rated it poorly .The pollster notes that these marks are comparable to all who have health insurance . However , those newly insured through the exchanges are more satisfied with the cost of health care — with 75 percent saying so — versus 61 percent of all insured respondents who said they were satisfied with the cost of health care .
Ezra Klein directs us to the latest from the Kaiser Family Foundation , which asks what the average Obamacare 2015 premium increase will be for those places for which we have full information — and finds that premiums will actually decline slightly . Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment:Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress , who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare’s cost , that the law would be cheaper than predicted and , at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars , cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought . After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security , let’s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet . What odds do you think Obamacare’s critics would have offered ? 2:1 ? 5:1 ? 10:1 ?But you don’t have to go back to 2010 . Look at John Cochrane in late 2013 , taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months . Look at The Hill just four months ago , telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming .One question we might ask here is , why is the news so good ? The answer , I’d suggest — although I hope the real experts will weigh in — is that we’re actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral ; call it a life spiral . For one thing , the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected , and they now expect 2015 to be better still . Also , importantly , big enrollments mean that more insurers are entering the market , increasing competition . And , of course , the better the deal the more people will sign up : success feeds success .Another question we might ask : Is our conservatives learning ? Are those who bought into the death spiral stories , who seized on every hint of bad news , asking themselves how they got it so wrong ? Are they , maybe , considering the possibility that they’re listening to the wrong people , that maybe Jon Gruber knows what he’s talking about and John Goodman is a hack ?Hahahaha .
SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat — potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states — currently 14 — that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case “en banc” on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through “an Exchange” that is “established by a State” means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help — in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges — two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent — and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable .
On Thursday morning , as almost everyone predicted it would , the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. , voted to toss out a three-judge panel’s ruling upholding the latest attempt to kill “Obamacare.” The full 11-member court is scheduled to rehear the case on Dec. 17 .The claim this time was that subsidies for the health exchanges that are at the heart of the law are available only to those exchanges “established by the State.” In other words , not available in the three dozen states where the federal government has set up an exchange because the state refused to . This would result in the denial of coverage to an estimated 4.7 million Americans . To succeed , the claim required that those four words be considered in a hermetically sealed tube , independent from the rest of the 900-page law , whose core purpose was to ensure affordable health-care to lower-income Americans .Luckily for the challengers , two of the three panel judges in the case , Halbig v. Burwell , were sympathetic to that way of reading the law . The third was less impressed , calling it a “not-so-veiled attempt to gut” the Affordable Care Act .The rehearing will occur before a court with a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents . For that reason , many predict that the court will side with the government and reject the challengers’ claim .This matters because the challengers desperately wanted to pole-vault over the D.C. appeals court and go straight to the Supreme Court — where they believe they have their best shot at winning once and for all . It’s the high-stakes version of what lawyers call “forum-shopping” — each side maneuvering to get a case into the court where they feel their chances are best .While it’s generally wise to avoid gaming out judges’ votes based simply on the party of their appointing president , in the Halbig case , that has been a reliable proxy .Of course , a key reason for the current makeup of the D.C. appeals court is the Senate’s reform of the filibuster process last fall , which was triggered by Republicans’ refusal to allow a vote on any of President Obama’s three nominees to that court . After the reform , all three nominees were confirmed .If anyone was wondering what the hue and cry over filibuster reform was really about in practice , the Halbig case is Exhibit A .
It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term “Obamacare.” So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , it’s fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races “are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act.” Here’s the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course haven’t embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that it’s actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that it’s not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls .
In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacare’s claim to be a policy success , I didn’t directly address the law’s eventual impact on the deficit . So I’m grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the law’s promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryan’s words ) on “gimmicks and smoke and mirrors , ” Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the law’s coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the right’s inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Office’s update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the right’s certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : It’s focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesn’t address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that “CBO … can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues … isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.”So the report doesn’t tell us anything , and doesn’t claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they aren’t ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or … well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isn’t proof that the law is “even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast , ” because that simply isn’t a question it sets out to answer .This doesn’t mean , though , that we can’t make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that what’s happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions — delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPAB’s mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didn’t include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success … because it’s entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable — but it’s not clear , given the law’s coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way that’s much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the law’s architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point we’ll actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors — but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that can’t necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.’s point about the difficulty of “isolating” the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that it’s entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on America’s fiscal picture overall — because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers’ options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of “double counting” and “gimmickry” and the like — they’re saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , you’re engaged in something other than “fiscal conservatism , ” because you haven’t actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe — hopefully — a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But it’s quite possible that we’ll end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that it’s created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point .
No , I haven’t lost my mind — or suddenly become an Ayn Rand disciple . It’s not my ideal ; in a better world I’d call for single-payer , and a significant role for the government in directly providing care .But Ross Douthat , in the course of realistically warning his fellow conservatives that Obamacare doesn’t seem to be collapsing , goes on to tell them that they’re going to have to come up with a serious alternative .But Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , and not just because it was originally devised at the Heritage Foundation . It’s what a health-care system that does what even conservatives say they want , like making sure that people with preexisting conditions can get coverage , has to look like if it isn’t single-payer .I don’t really think one more repetition of the logic will convince many people , but here we go again . Suppose you want preexisting conditions covered . Then you have to impose community rating — insurers must offer the same policies to people regardless of medical history . But just doing that causes a death spiral , because people wait until they’re sick to buy insurance . So you also have to have a mandate , requiring healthy people to join the risk pool . And to make buying insurance possible for people with lower incomes , you have to have subsidies .And what you’ve just defined are the essentials of ObamaRomneyCare . It’s a three-legged stool that needs all three legs . If you want to cover preexisting conditions , you must have the mandate ; if you want the mandate , you must have subsidies . If you think there’s some magic market-based solution that obviates the stuff conservatives don’t like while preserving the stuff they like , you’re deluding yourself .What this means in practice is that any notion that Republicans will go beyond trying to sabotage the law and come up with an alternative is fantasy . Again , Obamacare is the conservative alternative , and you can’t move further right without doing no reform at all .
So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is “a failure on a number of levels” . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But it’s not just misinformation ; the reality doesn’t matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed .
One of the odd rituals of American punditry — the most famous example is Karl Rove’s tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time — is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and let’s dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , what’s the point ? The votes are already in ; you can’t build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldn’t election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know that’s what the base believes , because it’s what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not — if famous senators don’t have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But that’s really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , there’s not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even that’s doubtful — by the fall , we’re going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the — to use the technical term — wussiness of it all . Isn’t there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that it’s not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes .
Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . They’ve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasn’t such a good idea — in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But it’s really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that they’re against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of “cooking the books” to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why don’t they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?
If you’ve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act – which is easy thanks to Charles Gaba’s invaluable site – you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , it’s official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But here’s the thing : every online article I’ve seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isn’t true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium – ahem , 47 percent of the total – will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You can’t help but notice the resemblance to the “unskewing” fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I don’t know that for sure – but it’s very unlikely that they’re right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers – people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO – which has a reputation to defend – thinks it’s going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldn’t be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that it’s not going to happen is furious denial .
Here and here and here .A sample:Well , I suppose some of the people who predicted doom will reconsider their views , and engage in some soul-searching about why they were so wrong — maybe even realize that they were letting their politics distort their analysis .You can stop laughing now .
The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the law’s supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured:… The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents’ plans . There’s been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates I’ve seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and you’re close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . That’s what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , it’s insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says “in the same ballpark , ” he means “in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected.” That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right we’re probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( I’m relying on “best estimates” for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohn’s ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower … you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesn’t really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped — making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so — or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers — the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs — that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent “what count as success” list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think it’s entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the law’s supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what we’re seeing at the moment — even if there’s still a long , long way to go .
Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups — an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative — namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we don’t yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we don’t know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we don’t know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and won’t for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , they’ll spend months listening to “unskewers” claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and can’t replace it , etc , etc.. There really isn’t any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work .
Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacare’s repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare state’s ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacare’s critics as well . What isn’t killed outright grows stronger the longer it’s embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesn’t work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes — it’s possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But it’s still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that “possible , ” and change the “likely” to an “all-but-definite.” Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We don’t know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We don’t know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We don’t know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly don’t know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there won’t be an immediate political unraveling , and that we aren’t headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bill’s architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the law’s opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive .
WashingtonIF Mitt Romney’s pivots on President’s Obama’s health care reform act have accelerated to a blur — from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states — it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan’s passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , “government takeover of health care.” It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system — principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The president’s program extends the current health care system — mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals — by removing the biggest obstacles to that system’s functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability — yes , another conservative idea . Under today’s system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals’ coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans — with their own money on an exchange — first floated around Washington , advocates called them “association health plans.” They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration’s reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of “Hillarycare” in the mid-’90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform — essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romney’s argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states’ rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare .
WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing , by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues — the famous “third rails” of American politics — none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obama’s estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palin’s rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obama’s , it holds limited promise for containing the program’s escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .That’s where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryan’s approach was rendered toothless when the issue’s brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular “waste , fraud and abuse” ) .If the cap was breached — as it almost certainly would eventually be — Mr. Ryan blithely says , “Congress would be required to intervene.” Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obama’s hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obama’s credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan’s ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board can’t propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .That’s the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : “Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.”To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews can’t be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Let’s not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan’s competition or Mr. Obama’s innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the program’s budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , it’s natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled — including Canada , Australia and New Zealand — have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatment’s ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable .
Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .…The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 .
The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the law’s coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , it’s likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .It’s actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesn’t appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBO’s primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges — what the administration calls “marketplaces”— are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be .
The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , “substantial shares” of the uninsured population don’t realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .“As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the law’s subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half don’t know about the law’s expansion of Medicaid.”
The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If you’ve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .It’s easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasn’t even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly — they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers weren’t allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they don’t know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administration’s lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you weren’t reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 …
LOS ANGELES â THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Iâd be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonâs long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyâs â I paraphrase â draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would âbe actually much richer.âI , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .âObamacare or Kafkacare ? â I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Iâm a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the âlike.â Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyâd commiserate .Except that they didnât .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , âMy dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because itâs free , â my respondents implied â in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more âlikesâ â that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .âThe nation has been better off , â wrote one friend . âOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.â Thatâs all fine and good for âthe nation , â but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , âYes , Iâm paying an extra 200 a month , but Iâm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.âI was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyâs well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnât affect people directly , they became âtheoretically generous.â Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance â which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do â and Iâll bet theyâd change their tune about âending inequalityâ and âcreating fairnessâ and âdoing whatâs good for the country.âRefreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnât have to pay for everyone elseâs pregnancies . Little did I know Iâd end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elseâs pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , âBut , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! âLike Bridget Jonesâs âsmug marrieds , â the âsmug insuredsâ â friends who were covered through their own or spousesâ employers or who were grandfathered into their plans â asked why I didnât âjustâ switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Iâm dating . How romantic : âI didnât marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.âAlong with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnât care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itâs for the good of the country , a vast improvement âover all.âAnd the âover allâ might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because itâs trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well â as long as yours isnât the âfortunateâ family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single âlike.â Itâs the lone âlikeâ that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear .
FRANKFORT , Ky. â SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky â more quickly than almost any other state â moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because thereâs a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Itâs no coincidence that numerous governors â not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan â see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residentsâ collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Weâre making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thatâs almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they donât get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctorâs appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger â jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckyâs uninsured â mostly the working poor â will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckyâs economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnât afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage â most with a discount â through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckyâs Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we canât implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Iâm offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Itâs shameful that these critics havenât invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work â when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckyâs families , I say , âGet over it.âThe Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life .
Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads they’ve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture — they’re suffering !OK , we’ve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking American’s brave fighting men and women ?But there’s a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters — a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he can’t possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it can’t be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then it’s worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So here’s what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isn’t magic — it produces losers as well as winners . But it’s not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people — the healthy and wealthy — to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , it’s almost certainly not true — people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they can’t be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers — people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories — the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false — because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen .
Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isn’t actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect .
You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youâd be wrong .After Paul Ryanâs fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that stateâs Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlerâs mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnât need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that heâs been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senateâs prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program canât be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyâre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Itâs not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankersâ bonuses were intended âto get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses.â This , he added , was âsort of like what we did in the Deep South.âHow absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Weâre awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and itâs impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Thereâs seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it canât be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianaâs Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that dayâs horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring â-gateâ mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixonâs crimes , we dilute them . Itâs just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintonâs private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.âs scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I canât even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnât matter . Itâs to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothingâs distinctive . Itâs all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , weâd be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : âBoehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage.â That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamaâs agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whatâs just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Weâre in an unfortunate place , but we neednât travel back there to describe it .
Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator who’s running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a “disaster.” Then he was asked what he’s for — and he went on to describe Obamacare . “I’ve always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee , ” he said . “That’s all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do.” He even said it could “include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.”Oh , he also promises his plan won’t raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare .
Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts — here , and then here — defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , “won , ” and that conservatives who can’t come to terms with that victory can’t come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track , ” and concludes that “ [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success , ” it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing , isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the law’s supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible — and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.’s more modest projection for this year .So … how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.’s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesn’t ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , it’s only fallen by , say , 15 million instead — and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably there’s some kind of shortfall that the law’s supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the law’s supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating “that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.”Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this year’s roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the law’s supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacare’s impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed — so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words — what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . It’s been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver — with writers like Klein famously invoking “lives saved” figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the law’s passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , I’m curious what liberals expect to see , what they’ll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , I’ll lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflation’s five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled “I Was Wrong About Obamacare” — or , if he prefers , just “Ezra Klein Was Right.”
TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the president’s enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the president’s Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics “expose” the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , they’re actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romney’s car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure they’ll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the “affordable” part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet — I would be remiss if I didn’t say this — Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughter’s spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she won’t be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Let’s not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year — money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients’ health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermont’s plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . That’s why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators who’ll go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So let’s get started . Obamacare can’t be fixed by its namesake . It’s up to us to make it happen .
A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling stands—a big if—it could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didn’t qualify for tax credits after all .
The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : It’s going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true .
Yesterday , Ohio governor John Kasich briefly made news when the Associated Press quoted him saying that repeal of Obamacare was simply “not gon na happen , ” and adding that “the opposition to it was really either political or ideological , ” and in either case insufficiently attuned to the “real improvements in people’s lives.” Liberals pounced , conservatives groaned , and Kasich quickly went into damage control mode , explaining that he was only talking about the Medicaid expansion , which he had already explicitly supported and implemented , and not the rest of the law , which he still officially wants to ( say it with me ) repealandreplace .That last is the official position , of course , of the entire Republican Party , which currently enjoys , per my colleagues at The Upshot , a 66 percent chance of seizing a Senate majority in two weeks time . But the controversy around Kasich’s comments are a useful reminder that not only is there no Republican consensus on how to actually replace the health care law , but almost no G.O.P . Senate candidates are actually campaigning on a politically credible replacement plan — with “politically credible” defined , for reasons I’ve elaborated on before , as “not rolling coverage levels back toward the pre-Obamacare status quo.”The one major exception is Ed Gillespie , running against Mark Warner in Virginia , whose plan Ramesh Ponnuru has commented on and defended here and here . ( Since Gillespie’s background is in what I’ve called the “donorist” wing of the party , which does not always distinguish itself in pushing middle-class-friendly economic policy , he deserves particular credit for taking the policy leap . ) But Gillespie is also , per current polling , unlikely to join a Republican Senate majority next year , whereas many G.O.P . candidates — the potential Majority Leader included — who have hemmed and hawed or talked in anti-Obamacare boilerplate and vague generalities when asked about health care policy are more likely to pull their races out . Which will be seen by some , no doubt , as vindicating the risk-averse , somewhat cynical approach to health policy that Republicans have taken throughout the health care debate …… except , of course , that in this cycle that debate is happening against the backdrop of a political map that heavily favors the G.O.P. , whereas in 2016 ( as in 2012 ) the map will be different , tougher , and the health care law ( while no doubt still unpopular overall ) will be more locked-in , more a part of people’s ordinary experience , and the promise of full repeal will look even sketchier than it does now . At which point a Republican Party that wants to be competitive nationally will start to feel a lot of pressure ( probably not quite enough to counteract the influence of the primary electorate , but we’ll see ) to drift toward something like Kasich’s ( quite popular , in a purple state ) position , which basically amounts to “if you like the single-payer part of Obamacare , you can keep the single-payer part of Obamacare , and let’s talk about the other stuff later.”For conservatives who don’t want their party to gradually , eventually , inevitably end up taking roughly that position in national elections , then , there’s a pretty narrow window to rally around something like the Gillespie approach instead . That window was open in this campaign ; I think it will be open again in 2016 . After that , though , the political risks ( already real enough ) associated with backing a legitimate Obamacare alternative will rise apace , the downsides of calling for outright repeal will likewise increase , and Republicans running for office outside red states will probably just end up endorsing the views that Ohio’s popular governor is dancing around right now .Of course events might intervene , but for now anti-Obamacare but reform-minded conservatives should be rooting for Gillespie to pull off a miracle comeback … because a party that can not imitate his Obamacre position today will almost certainly accept John Kasich’s position tomorrow .
A peculiar aspect of the Obama years has been the disconnect between the rage of Obama’s enemies and the yawns of his sort-of allies . The right denounces financial reform as a vast government takeover — and lobbies fiercely against it — while the left dismisses reform as symbols without substance . The right accuses Obama of being a socialist stealing the money of hard-working billionaires , while the left dismisses him as having done nothing to address inequality .On all these issues , the truth is that Obama has done far more than he gets credit for — not everything you’d want , to be sure , or even most of what should be done , but enough so that the right has reason to be furious .The latest case in point : taxes on the one percent . I keep hearing that Obama has done nothing to make the one percent pay more ; the Congressional Budget Office does not agree:According to CBO , the effective tax rate on the one percent — reflecting the end of the Bush tax cuts at the top end , plus additional taxes associated with Obamacare — is now back to pre-Reagan levels . You could argue that we should have raised taxes at the top much more , to lean against the widening of market inequality , and I would agree . But it’s still a much bigger change than I think anyone on the left seems to realize .
Or , actually , demonstrates by example what’s wrong with Washington .Matt Yglesias finds Ron Fournier saying this about health reform:On health care , we needed a market-driven plan that decreases the percentage of uninsured Americans without convoluting the U.S. health care system . Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale , we got more partisan warfare . The GOP resisted , Obama surrendered his mantle of bipartisanship , and Democrats muscled through a one-sided law that has never been popular with a majority of the public .The mind reels . How is it possible for anyone who has been following politics and , presumably , policy for the past six years not to know that Obamacare is , in all important respects , identical to Romneycare ? It has the same three key provisions — nondiscrimination by insurers , a mandate for individuals , and subsidies to make the mandate workable . It was developed by the same people . I and many others have frequently referred to ObamaRomneycare .Well , I’ve know for years that many political pundits don’t think that understanding policy is part of their job . But this is still extreme . And I’m sorry to go after an individual here — but for God’s sake , don’t you have to know something about the actual content of a policy you critique ?And what’s actually going on here is worse than ignorance . It’s pretty clear that we’re watching a rule of thumb according to which if Republicans are against a proposal , that means it must be leftist and extreme , and the burden on the White House is to find a way to make the GOP happy . Needless to say , this rewards obstructionism — there is literally nothing Obama can do to convince some ( many ) pundits that he’s making a good faith effort , because they don’t pay any attention to what he does , only to the Republican reaction .Awesome .
Very busy , so no substantive posting today . But I did want to share a thought from the past few days . I posted about the surprisingly good news , at least so far , on Obamacare premiums for 2015 — and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right . The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else ( except maybe climate science ) matches .No news there . Nor is it news that such people know things that ain’t so . But there’s something I’ve noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare . It goes like this : a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting . Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted — especially , of course , but not only by Fox , the WSJ , etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasn’t really that bad , these sources just move on . There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage — headlines ! When it turns out not to be true — crickets ! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits — big news ! Actual premium numbers come in and they’re surprisingly low — not mentioned .The result is that most news consumers — who form impressions rather than trying to work out details — have the sense that it’s been all bad news . This is true even for people who don’t rely on Fox — I get asked about the scary premium hikes by people on the Upper West Side ! And of course for those who do get their news from Fox , well , they know , just know , that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something , even though even their favorite news source isn’t saying such things .We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded ; maybe fossils instead of zombies . Anyway , it’s striking .
One thing about the Obamacare denialists : they don’t give up . First nobody but the sick would sign up , so we’d have a death spiral . Then it was “OK , a lot of people have signed up , but they won’t pay — and anyway , even more people have lost coverage.” Now they face evidence like this:And the response I’m seeing is “It’s not Obamacare , it’s the improving economy” .But it isn’t . The decline is too sharp , too closely associated with the enrollment period to be driven by the at best gradual improvement in the job market . But wait , there’s more . The Urban Institute breaks down the decline in uninsurance by Medicaid adoption or not , which is closely correlated with the general question of whether states are helping implementation or blocking it . Here’s how it looks:Sorry , an improving economy can’t explain why the decline in uninsured is three times as large in pro-Obamacare states as it is in anti-reform states .It’s the policy , stupid .
President Obama wrote on Monday that the Federal Communications Commission should issue strong regulations to prevent cable and phone companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes .Writing in more detail than he has offered previously on the subject , Mr. Obama said the commission , which is independent of the administration , should undo a long-standing regulatory mistake by re-classifying broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service , not a lightly-regulated information service . That would allow the commission to ban cable and phone companies from blocking , slowing down or otherwise interfering with the videos , music and other content that their customers access on the Internet . As we wrote in an editorial on Sunday , under current rules companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable have the right to favor some content over others . For example , they could decide to deliver content from a provider that pays them a fee faster than information from competing services . Such arrangements would limit consumer choice and the ability of start-ups to compete on the Web .“We can not allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas , ” Mr. Obama wrote .Not surprisingly , cable and phone companies and some of their supporters in Congress are not happy with Mr. Obama’s proposal . Comcast issued a statement calling it “a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation , as today’s immediate stock market reaction demonstrates.” ( Shares of Comcast were down 3.8 percent at noon , but shares in Verizon and AT & T were up slightly . ) Senator Ted Cruz tried , confusingly and desperately , to link Mr. Obama’s proposal to health reform , a favorite whipping boy of Republicans that is actually working quite well:“Net Neutrality” is Obamacare for the Internet ; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government .— Senator Ted Cruz ( @ SenTedCruz ) 10 Nov 14The industry’s concerns are unfounded and self-interested . And the reaction of lawmakers like Mr. Cruz is partisan hyperbole . Mr. Obama made clear that he does not want the F.C.C . to regulate broadband as it regulates traditional telephone service even if it reclassifies it as a telecommunications service . For example , there is no reason for the commission to regulate the price of Internet service , as regulators do for traditional home phone lines .But other telecommunications rules should apply . For example , federal telephone regulations make sure that you can use your AT & T phone to call people using T-Mobile by requiring the companies to connect their networks to each other . The same should be true on the Internet – you should be able to use Netflix just as easily as you would be able to use Amazon’s streaming service .This is at the heart of what Mr. Obama is proposing:For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business . That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider . It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call , or a packet of data .Mr. Obama’s reasoning might not satisfy phone and cable companies or their friends in Congress , who have a visceral allergic reaction to regulations . But that should not stop the F.C.C . from adopting his well-argued proposal .
David Brooks : Well , that was pretty much a complete drubbing .Gail Collins : Don’t rub it in , David .David : I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska , Virginia and Louisiana . The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive . Scott Walker’s win in Wisconsin was pretty significant . The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland . Plus Bruce Rauner’s win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge . This was a national verdict .Gail : Yeah , things were even worse than I expected . The most depressing result , for me , was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas . If you can wreck the state’s economy and not get punished at all — I don’t know what there is to say .David : It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism . The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair . Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses ?Gail : Well , I guess that’s better than staying here under the bed , curled in a fetal position . You first .David : I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats’ losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it . The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems . President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare . He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive , not competent , not in control . The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term .Gail : I agree that the president has often seemed passive . And there’s been a lot of misspeaking for somebody who’s supposed to be a great communicator . But I don’t buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality . Raise the minimum wage , create good jobs improve the nation’s roads and bridges , expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost – that’s pretty much all they talked about .David : The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand . Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people . They no longer seem that way . The wins in purple states like North Carolina , Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters . And if the G.O.P . presents a reasonable candidate ( and this year’s crop was very good ) , then Republicans can win anywhere . I think we’ve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase .Gail : I wouldn’t call this year’s crop very good , except in the sense that they’re definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons . Although some – like Joni Ernst , who won the Senate seat in Iowa – are still downright scary .But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness .David : I was especially struck by Ed Gillespie’s amazing showing in Virginia . He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country . At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters’ intelligence with dumb campaigns , he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it , win or lose . Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants .Gail : Virginia shocked me . And Kay Hagan’s loss in North Carolina saddened me . The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory .David : Scott Walker’s victory in Wisconsin is also significant . The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions , even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin . Faced with a budget crisis , a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive . He’ll become a compelling national figure in 2016 .Gail : Yeah , when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers , the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape . The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector .David : I wouldn’t give up on private sector unions . I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers , even if it doesn’t look like the 20th-century model .Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate . Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night .Gail : That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire , but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in . I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California , where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016 . There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge .David : I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race . Sort of a setup for a U.P.S . advertising campaign . The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda . Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task .Gail : See , that’s the frustrating thing . For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues . But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership . And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock .David : For Democrats , I guess one big lesson is : Stop talking to each other . Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers . That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions , but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares .Gail : It’s totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain . Although there was that one brief , shining moment in 2000 – John McCain . Presidential primary . New Hampshire . Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics .Gone but not quite forgotten .David : Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook — all the talk about contraception and “women’s” issues . That was tone deaf , given where the country is .Gail : I don’t agree at all . Of course you can’t give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing you’re running on . But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and I’ll tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter .The Democrats aren’t going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago . Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain . You know , the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink , smoke and discuss serious topics .David : Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again . That means winning in places likes Arkansas , once solid Democratic states . Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority — hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power . That still may happen over the long term , but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters , especially less-educated white voters .Gail : No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like , you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time . But it’s not easy to do . I don’t think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters’ needs . They’re just appealing to their fear of change .David : The core problem for Democrats , it seems to me , is that voters are just too skeptical of government — at least as it currently exists . Obamacare may not have been a huge issue , but Republicans ran lots of ads about it , and it remains deeply unpopular . Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective .Gail : The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government , even when they benefit greatly from government programs . And it’s ironic that President Obama , who ran as a great communicator , has been so awful at countering that message .David : The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidency’s power on the domestic front . In 2008 , I would not have expected it to come to this . The verdict is still out on what Obama’s legacy will be , but it’s certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R. , Reagan and even Clinton did — in building a plausible majority for his party .Gail : I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 . But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner . If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change , he’ll have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did . But I guess the nation won’t learn to appreciate him unless he’s impeached .
The politics of Obamacare are clearly starting to shift . It’s not that the public is coming to love it — not yet , anyway . But it’s less and less of a bogeyman , with polls suggesting a majority of the public against flat-out repeal . So there’s increasing pressure on Republicans to lay out an alternative — and continuing surprise about their inability to articulate one .But this is an example of why it sometimes helps , even in straight political reporting , to understand how policy works . Here’s the essential fact about health care policy , which in turn fundamentally shapes health care politics:Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to .Once again , for those who missed it : if you want to cover people with preexisting conditions , you must have community rating . If you want to have community rating without a death spiral — that is , if you want to keep an acceptable risk pool — you have to have an individual mandate . If you want to have an individual mandate , you have to have subsidies for lower-income Americans . And that’s Obamacare : a three-legged stool , with all three legs essential .Republicans can’t offer an alternative because there isn’t one ( aside , that is , from single-payer ) . Their plan , such as it was , was to wait for the plan to implode , so they would never be put on the spot ; since that isn’t happening , Plan B is to bob and weave and avoid the question until the midterms . That’s all there is .
For reference : I count at least six distinct predictions of Obamacare doom made by the usual suspects , not one of which has come true . Here they are:1 . Enrollment will be very low , and2 . Even if people sign up , they won’t pay their premiums .Reality : Signups exceeded expectations , and the vast majority paid .3 . More people will lose coverage cancelled by Obamacare than gain it .Reality : Sharp drop in the number of uninsured .4 . Rate shock .Reality : Like it says , affordable care .5 . Young people not signing up , and death spiral .Reality : Pretty good demographics .6 . Soaring health costs .Reality : Health costs are below anyone’s expectations .It’s quite an impressive track record , actually . And what’s even more impressive is that none of the usual suspects will even consider admitting having been wrong .
LEXINGTON , Ky. – Political campaigns aren’t generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday night’s debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since she’s fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom she’d voted in the 2012 presidential election . I’ll take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say — because she’s petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , who’s been in Washington long enough —30 years — to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . “It’s an entry-level wage , ” said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was “not a scientist , ” Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : “There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.”Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimes’s “ballot box secrecy”-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if “Obamacare and Kynect” had been “a boon or bane” for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect — which is the state’s health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act — is a runaway success .Mr. McConnell’s attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be “pulled out root and branch.” As for Kynect , that’s just “a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.”Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . “Yeah , I think it’s fine to have a website , yeah , ” said the senator .That’s like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on .
Many news reports are doing their best to somehow spin the final Obamacare surge as a negative story — yes , the website did go down a couple of times due to volume , which never , ever happens to commercial sites . The narrative of Obamacare-as-failure must not be challenged !But the narrative is getting really hard to sustain . Charles Gaba:There’s the usual yammering about “But how many have PAID ? ? ? ” , “But how many were ALREADY INSURED ? ? ? ” , “How many were YOUNG ? ? ? ” and “What METAL LEVEL did they get ? ? ? ” etc etc etc . All of these are reasonable questions for actuarials , accountants and so forth to ask , and the answers will indeed help shape our understanding of what the overall economic and health status of the population at large will be .For the moment , however , none of that matters . This is an outstanding number any way you slice it .Meanwhile , via Wonkbook , a guide to “unskewing” the numbers . Yep , I blame zombie ACORN .
My Sunday column considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obama’s long year of low approval ratings , which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow . The big four I considered were structural forces ( the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s ) , the essential mediocrity of our “recovered” economy , the continued unpopularity of Obamacare , and foreign policy ( where the president’s approval ratings have fallen hard ) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administration’s basic competence . Obviously there are many more factors one could consider , but since I write about the issue frequently I thought I should explain why I didn’t include immigration , another area where the president’s approval numbers have plummeted as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year .My reasoning , basically , was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever : I just don’t see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes , white or Hispanic or otherwise , no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment . It’s true that recent events ( the child migrant surge , the White House’s strange handling of its promised amnesty , the climate of Ebola-related anxiety ) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago , and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment with the president . But I still feel that immigration is ultimately more a kind of subplot within the broader categories my column proposed — one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence , or one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock — than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the president’s weakened position .Some evidence : If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities , immigration is ( of course ) swamped by the economy , but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues , which I think has played a much larger role in undercutting the public’s approval of the president . Likewise , if you look at this feature that maps midterm-election conversations on social media , you’ll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already “overwhelmingly represented by Republicans , ” rather than dominating the conversation in swing states . Again , that doesn’t mean it’s an inconsequential issue , but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the president’s ( un ) popularity and his party’s midterm fate .I could be wrong , of course . If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus for a day and elevate immigration’s significance a little higher , it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the president’s 2008/2012 majority , and how the Democratic Party’s diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry . That is , up until recently , immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters — because what he was promising to activists ( the DREAM Act ) was pretty popular and didn’t conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border , because there’s broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters aren’t exactly detail-oriented , and because the G.O.P.’s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue . But once the border started to look less secure ( in part , perhaps , because of DREAM-created incentives ) and activists started demanding something much bigger ( the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer , than walked back ) , Obama’s two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle … effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies , emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking , and opening space between the so-called “coalition of the ascendant” and the older , whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in , say , Iowa .I think this analysis has some merit ( not surprisingly , since I just spun it ) ; I just don’t think it proves immigration’s major salience in knocking down the president’s approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle . But we’ll get an interesting test in New Hampshire , where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue ; if he pulls out an upset , my estimation of immigration’s impact on Obama’s swoon and 2014’s outcomes will go up . And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obama’s struggles , the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era , in ways that I’m sure I’ll have reason to discuss again .
You still encounter people claiming that Obamacare has been a disaster , that more people have lost insurance than gained it , etc. , etc . But the reality is that it has already made a big dent in the number of uninsured ; and the quality of insurance has gone up , too , because canceled policies were canceled because they offered little real protection .Of course , the coming of the law in January 2014 has been a big job-killer .. or maybe not:This is what success looks like .

Greg Sargent notes that the midterm election , which was supposed to be a referendum on Obamacare , isn’t looking at all like that in practice ; Republican ads denouncing health reform have been dwindling month by month .The reason is fairly obvious , although it’s not considered nice to state it bluntly : the attack on Obamacare depended almost entirely on lies , and those lies are becoming unsustainable now that the law is actually working . No , there aren’t any death panels ; no , huge numbers of Americans aren’t losing coverage or finding their health costs soaring ; no , jobs aren’t being killed in vast numbers . A few relatively affluent , healthy people are paying more for coverage ; a few high-income taxpayers are paying more in taxes ; a much larger number of Americans are getting coverage that was previously unavailable and/or unaffordable ; and most people are seeing no difference at all , except that they no longer have to fear what happens if they lose their current coverage .In other words , reform is working more or less the way it was supposed to ( except for the Medicaid expansion in non-cooperating states ) .Many of us argued all along that the right’s chance to kill reform would vanish once the program was actually in place ; the horror stories only worked as long as the truth wasn’t visible . And that’s what seems to be happening .
Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who can’t keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why we’re a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , I’ve been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Here’s one core point : “Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the ‘unanticipated’ happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.”Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next week’s election ? There’s been a lot of complaint about the administration’s ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : You’re using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an “objective correlative” is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . It’s an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I don’t think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagan’s press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . It’s not in the president’s job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know I’m preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising they’re going to end gridlock , but if there’s anything we’ve learned since Obama was elected , it’s that you don’t end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just don’t trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . I’m struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states don’t try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said she’d support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the “Iowa nice” candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesota’s slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which we’re morally obliged to start making predictions . What’s yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but I’m guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that we’re not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close there’ll be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldn’t the decade’s most content-less campaign go into overtime ? I’m sort of amazed that this election hasn’t been about jobs and the economy . It hasn’t been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : There’s something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : “Vote for the Crook.” Which , blessedly , the people did .David : I’ll take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You can’t say Louisiana isn’t interesting . And if there’s a runoff at least then we’d be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when we’ll be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men.” Trollope’s “Phineas Finn” is second .And don’t knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : What’s the state you’re following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , they’ll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators don’t ever want to retire . What’s fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But there’s Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didn’t even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . They’ve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess that’s called knowing your subject .Gail : It’s interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governor’s race , they’d have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I don’t think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesn’t suit them . Among other things , it doesn’t go with their pastels .Gail : I don’t want anybody to imagine that I’m making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase “not yet indicted” is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election that’s really surprised you ? I didn’t expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think he’s actually interested in running again ? They say third time’s a charm .David : Trust me . He isn’t running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that don’t seem to work in politics these days it’s authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesn’t fit the national mood .
The Kaiser Family Foundation has a new survey ( pdf ) on Obamacare in California , and it’s full of remarkably good news . For those who haven’t been following this , CA — with its now-dominant Democratic Party — is where Obamacare was implemented the way it was supposed to be implemented : the website worked pretty well from the beginning , Medicaid expansion was implemented , and the state worked hard on outreach . It was also a place that really needed reform : the uninsured were a high percentage of the population , and an individual market without community rating meant that the mere hint of a preexisting condition was enough to prevent coverage .So it now appears that most of California’s uninsured — 58 percent of the total , or well over 60 percent of those eligible ( because undocumented immigrants aren’t covered ) have gained insurance in the first year . Considering the complexity of the scheme , that’s really impressive , and it strongly suggests that next year , once those who missed out have had a chance to learn via word of mouth , California will have gotten much of the way toward universal coverage for legal residents .But there’s something else the Kaiser report drives home : most of those gaining coverage are doing so not via the exchanges ( although those are important too ) but via Medicaid . And that’s important as an answer to critics of Obamacare from the left .There have always been critics complaining that what we really should have is single-payer , and angry that subsidies were being funneled through the insurance companies . And in principle they’re right ; the trouble was that cutting the insurers out of the loop would have made the plan politically impossible , both because of the industry’s power and because of the unwillingness of people with good coverage to take a leap into a completely new system . So we got this awkward public-private hybrid , which I supported because it was what we could get and despite its impurity it dramatically improves many people’s lives .But it turns out that many of the newly insured are in fact being covered under a single-payer system — Medicaid . And as I’ve pointed out before,Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .All in all , liberals really should be celebrating . California shows how Obamacare can and should work , and it’s looking pretty good .
These are tough times for opponents of health care reform . They bet everything on a debacle , but Obamacare has failed to fail — and their efforts to deny the increasingly obvious success of the law are beginning to look ridiculous .Oh , and they can’t come up with a conservative alternative ; Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , a way to achieve sorta-kinda universal coverage without single payer , and all of its main elements are essential parts of the package .So what’s left ? Claims that guaranteed health insurance is an assault on America’s freedom .Bill Gardner at The Incidental Economist offers a rather decorous , mild reply to the people making this argument . I’d put it more forcefully : the pre-ACA system drastically restricted many people’s freedom , because given the extreme dysfunctionality of the individual insurance market , they didn’t dare leave jobs ( or in some cases marriages ) that came with health insurance . Now that affordable insurance is available even if you don’t have a good job at a big company , many Americans will feel liberated — and this hugely outweighs the minor infringement on freedom caused by the requirement that people buy insurance . ( Also , if you don’t like the mandate , why not support single payer ? )But no discussion of this latest argument should fail to mention the original insurance-is-slavery campaign — Operation Coffeecup , in which the AMA recruited doctors’ wives to gather their friends and listen to a recording of Ronald Reagan declaring that Medicare would destroy American liberty .Strange to say , that didn’t happen . And Obamacare won’t turn into a form of slavery , either . On the contrary , as I said , it will be a liberating force for many Americans .

Gail Collins : David , you’ve been enthusiastic about the Senate race in Kansas , where an independent , Greg Orman , became a surprise front-runner . Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota . Are you excited ?David Brooks : Have you ever heard of negative panic ? In times of chaos or extreme excitement , before a fire or an oncoming tornado , some people act with extreme calm , as if everything is normal . Their brains just don’t know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances don’t exist . Many people die because they don’t take the simple evasive action that would save their lives .I am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal . I give off the appearance of extreme calm . But deep down I’m rippling with excitement . Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic .Gail : I may have gotten carried away . I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa .But we’ve only got three more weeks of this election season , so you have to humor me . In South Dakota , Mike Rounds , the Republican Senate candidate , was supposed to win . Then he got mired in a scandal . It’s one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like “allegations of corruption.”David : Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited ? Now I’ve been there a few times . What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other . You’d think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldn’t have time for east/west . I guess the winters are long .I don’t know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality .Gail : Well , Rounds hasn’t run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans don’t like that tone . Although to be fair , until recently he didn’t think he had any competition . People who are basically running unopposed love the high road .The Democrat , Rick Weiland , has been running as a populist-liberal , and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely . Then Larry Pressler , a former Republican senator now turned independent , began to get traction . Now anything seems possible .David : I love the fact that Pressler is back , once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature , that there are no second acts in American life .Gail : Oh my gosh , I totally agree with you . Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts .David : Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act . The guy was a Rhodes Scholar , a Vietnam vet . He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president . That’s a long time ago . He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal . Here’s a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:“Thanks to the F.B.I.’s undercover ‘sting’ operation , there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought . Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress , there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-SD ) tells the undercover agents , in effect , to take their sting and stick it . Pressler , according to law enforcement sources , was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors , as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs . At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.”Gail : I do love listening to you read the news . And you brought back Abscam ! It’s comforting , at minimum , to know there was at least one senator who didn’t immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle .David : So yes , I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate . That said , I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him .Gail : So we agree South Dakota is – yes ! – exciting . And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents .Here’s what worries me about that . There are already two official independents in the Senate , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine . Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4 ? If the independents formed their own little caucus , they’d have the deciding votes on everything . The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas , South Dakota , Vermont and Maine . Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population .David : Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence ? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center . Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states .Gail : Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington , D.C ? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls , which is more than Pat Roberts , the endangered Kansas senator , bothered to do .David : I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldn’t fly home every week . I don’t think it’s the time at home that ruins them ; it’s the airport food .I know people like me are always saying this , but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more . Plus , members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents ; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day .Gail : Well , sort of . Until the budget or the farm bill comes out , and everybody’s trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake .We do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year . Besides South Dakota and Kansas , there’s Louisiana , where Senator Mary Landrieu’s official state residence is in her parents’ house . And in Alaska , the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots .David : We’ve got to start paying these people more . With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C . levels , it’s expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state . I really think this residency business is a crazy issue .Gail : Maybe we could put up dorms . Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students .This is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered , one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven , Connecticut , Burger King outlet .David : I didn’t know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut .Gail : Ach , low blow .But it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear , competing agendas — plus the ability , at least in theory , to deliver on some of their promises .David : If one party or another had a total grip on the truth I’d agree with you . Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests . Independents , if they know their job , can help find this balance . If they don’t know their job they just waffle in the middle .Gail : Well , I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory .David : So true .Gail : Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue . Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots ?I don’t want to force your opinion , but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season .David : Sorry . I do think health care inflation is declining , which is fabulous news , either because of Obamacare or some other reason . But I’m afraid this issue will be with us forever . When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056 , we’ll still be talking about it .
Whenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling , do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff ?It happened with the economy . For the president’s staunchest defenders , legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done . Obama wasn’t perfect , but at least he wasn’t Bush .And with the Middle East , those defenders sometimes turn Bush’s epic mistakes into Obama’s hall pass . Perhaps he hasn’t figured out what’s right , but he isn’t guilty of the original wrong , which is constantly being litigated anew , as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014 .On Tuesday there was another spasm of this . As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists , Representative Lloyd Doggett , a Texas Democrat , digressed to inveigh against “the wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq , ” a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and can’t be un-rung now .And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear , what matters to many of Obama’s most stalwart fans isn’t whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists , turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence : not too little , not too much .At least he’s not Bush . He didn’t hallucinate weapons of mass destruction , make a spurious case for war or condone torture . I hear so much about Bush’s failings and Bush’s sins that you’d think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas .Enough . It’s true that Obama hasn’t replicated Bush’s offenses , and it’s consoling . But it isn’t exactly reason for a parade , and it doesn’t inoculate him . The culpability that lies elsewhere doesn’t relieve the responsibilities that are now his .And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good . Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short . The presidency isn’t “The Voice” ( though it is a little like “Survivor” ) . You’re not judged only in relation to the other performers who’ve been on stage . You’re judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place — by your ability to clean up the mess , not whether you made it .This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic . We’ve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next , be it Democratic or Republican .The I.R.S . scandal was not as bad as Watergate . ( Nothing’s ever as bad as Watergate , which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity . )The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina .It’s apples and hurricanes , but they’re put in the same basket , in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse . Don’t be mad , Mommy , about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels . Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair !I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates’ not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say .“Fewer Lies Than Nixon.” “Fewer Sweaters Than Carter.” “Fewer Interns Than Clinton.” “Better Speller Than Quayle.”It works in the other direction , too , and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings . Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks ; they’re rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Office’s current inhabitant and beat him over the head .Smack : That Teddy Roosevelt certainly understood the power of the bully pulpit ! Thwack : That L.B.J . really knew how to schmooze ! A president is like a second spouse living in the saintly shadow of a first one who perished too soon .George Santayana famously said that those who don’t know history are destined to repeat it . But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is , and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead ?If we’re determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama , let’s really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding . Golf wasn’t his only distraction . He also had a thing for poker . And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed , the 29th president , an Ohio Republican , reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job .By that measure Obama is a rock . But it doesn’t make him a boulder .
On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law’s critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that it’s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law’s coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , they’re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that’s more serious than some of the G.O.P.’s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindal’s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldn’t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you’ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives — because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , you’d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans don’t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases – and Jindal doesn’t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare’s passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .“I don’t think conservative health care reform is about saying we’re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card , ” he said . “That’s not the ultimate goal.”So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , I’m deeply skeptical of the “give everyone a Medicaid card” approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , I’m more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I don’t think there’s any question that Jindal’s argument — go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that — would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , here’s Ben Domenech , writing in yesterday’s edition of his newsletter The Transom:… when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people weren’t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort – the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs – and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it’s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law’s passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly — because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people’s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly — because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren’t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )I’d also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat — not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldn’t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party’s priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , it’s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldn’t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they’ll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but it’s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was — I believe — using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer — but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline … well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I’ve come to know and love so well .
As we await an official presidential response to last night’s Democratic debacle , here are two quotes that seem likely to frame the political class’s discussion of how the president might respond . First , from Politico , days before the drubbing , when the White House could still hope for just a modest setback at the polls:Administration officials tell us that Obama’s political and policy teams are planning a big counterattack if the Republicans win the Senate—introducing a slate of legislative proposals and executive actions on immigration , infrastructure and early childhood education that are popular with the Democratic base and that he will dare the GOP to oppose .And second , from an anonymous Dem bigwig talking to Business Insider last night:
I love voting . I love pretty much everything about it . My polling place is and has been for many years the Alfred E. Smith School , P.S . 163 , an elementary school . The voting booths are arrayed around a mottled , parquet gym floor , and there are always mothers running a bake sale outside to raise money for the school .Up until a few years ago , we voted on huge , metal machines that seemed like relics from the first days of the industrial age . Exercising the franchise was a pleasing combination of sacred civic ritual and theatricality . You waited in line , gave your name , signed the voting rolls , then were ushered behind a curtain that you closed by slamming a red-handled lever big enough to have served as a prop in “Modern Times” to one side . You flicked more mechanical switches to choose your candidates behind the curtain — a rare oasis of total privacy out in public Manhattan . You could even change your mind and flip them back , at least until the end , when you gave the lever a satisfying slam back the other way , and the curtain slid open . You half-expected the Wizard of Oz to appear .Now that was casting a vote !That’s all changed , thanks to our supposed concern about voter fraud . Since New York instituted its new , computerized voting system , the way things work are as follows : We line up to give our names and get a ballot . We then go a second line for the next available , barely private voting “booth” — in reality a table with a sort of sneeze guard around three sides . When we’re finished , we line up a third time to run our ballots through the next available computer , which assures us that our votes have been registered as we wanted , although who can possibly say . Knowing how protected vital American computer systems are against hackers , I’m waiting for the Election Day the screen tells me my candidate is stuck in Nigeria , and desperately needs a money order to get home and take office .The whole process not only takes three lines — something New Yorkers just love — and is barely private . Volunteers at the polls can easily see whom you voted for at the computers , and often must run the ballots through the scanners for the more elderly or infirm voters . So much for the sanctity of the ballot . The bake sales are still great , though .The lines were fairly sparse at the Smith school today , which inevitably led me to think back to the very long lines and the wild enthusiasm that imbued our first opportunity to vote for Barack Obama for president , in 2008 .“All politics is national” now , which made this midterm election yet another referendum on President Obama , and it has turned out to be another overwhelming repudiation of the president , who already suffered one debacle back in 2010 .This appears to have been a baffling rejection to this supremely detached president , whose supporters have been protesting that the public just does not appreciate all he has done — a list that invariably includes Obamacare , a revived stock market and an unemployment mark that has inched slowly downward .What the White House doesn’t seem to appreciate is just how little a dent this has made in the devastating loss of wealth , security and opportunity so many Americans have experienced in the last few years . But this administration has also been afflicted almost from the start with the inability to decide just whom it is trying to appeal to .Like Bill Clinton before him , this New Democrat president early on dismissed traditional liberals as “professional leftists” as his first press secretary once put it . But just a few months ago he also let his new F.C.C . chairman suggest an end to net neutrality , and his secretary of education heartily endorse the decision of a Republican judge ending teacher tenure , in which said judge claimed “there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.”Well , which is it ? Are you trying to build the new , white-collar Democratic Party or not , and if so , where do you expect these people to come from ?This sort of confusion about practical politics has long bedeviled New Democrats . And in fairness , we did let the president down , after that cool , cool fall day in 2008 . The sorts of sweeping , groundbreaking reforms we were hoping for — the change we could believe in — has never been accomplished from the top down in America , but has always meant a president gathering up the strands of many useful ideas and experiments , and working with the power , and often the hands , feet , elbows and knees , of grass-roots movements at his back .Franklin D. Roosevelt’s leading advisers , Harry L. Hopkins , Frances Perkins , Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace , among others , had labored long in the trenches on crucial issues of social welfare , labor rights , and land and farm preservation . The Tennessee Valley Authority came out of a decades-long struggle for public power , by Senator George W. Norris . No one in the Congress or Mr. Obama’s cabinet has provided anything like this sort of counsel , or experience .Nor has there been anything like the sorts of longstanding , populist , militant farm and labor movements that put the New Deal over . In the turmoil of the 1930s , worker uprisings literally took over waterfronts , factories , department stores and even the city of Minneapolis . Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park , then evaporated . It takes more than that — more than casting a vote every couple of years — to make change .
Gail Collins : David , it’s less than five weeks until Election Day . And people are so — um — how would you characterize the mood ?David Brooks : Let’s see . Giddy with disinterest . Tingling with unconscious ennui . Quivering with apathy . I’d say the public mood is paradoxical .Gail : Yet control of the Senate hangs in the balance ! And it’s all up to the voters in five to 10 states , which neither you nor I inhabit .David : I’m really glad to have been spared the agony of swing state envy . I’ve never lived in any state that isn’t solidly blue . So I’ve never known what it feels like to live in a place that has the excitement of competitive races . Hence I don’t feel the lack when that excitement goes away . You , coming from Ohio , are not so fortunate . Do you feel pain , perhaps in your wrists and other joints , watching faraway states get all the attention now that you live in a state of political indifference ? Swing state envy is like a concussion , not to be underestimated . I think I may start wearing a purple wrist-band as a sympathy statement .Gail : Our big New York news was that Gov . Andrew Cuomo , who’s up for re-election , found it necessary to go to Afghanistan this week . He sort of spun it as an effort to learn more about homeland security . But I honestly think you can do that in the homeland .David : I’m presuming this was not a hiking the Appalachian Trail sort of thing . Maybe he went to curry favor with the Pashtun population in Rye . Or for the golfing .Gail : Meanwhile his opponent , whose name recognition is limited to his immediate family , reprised that old Lyndon Johnson “Daisy” ad where the little girl is picking petals off a flower and then suddenly – countdown to Armageddon ! In this version , when the nuclear bomb goes off , Andrew Cuomo’s face comes out of the cloud .Did not expect an ad about atomic warfare in the New York gubernatorial race . Possible high point of the political week for me . How about you ? I know you’ve been taking the occasional gander at the big Senate races . What strikes you as interesting ?David : First the money . There’s been a ton of it , more than $ 228 million by outside groups alone so far . But the surprise in this post-Citizens-United era is that the Democrats are winning the money race so easily . I knew that the Democrats were the party of the rich plutocrats , but I didn’t realize how big the lead was . In North Carolina , pro-Democratic groups have a spending lead , $ 13 million to $ 8 million . In Iowa , the Democrats lead $ 9 million to $ 6 million . In Colorado , Democrats lead $ 10 million to $ 5 million . And so on in most states . If this continues Democrats are going to start loving that decision .Gail : I hope it keeps going like this . I’d love to watch Mitch McConnell and John Boehner demand that we do something about the poison of “super PACs.”Meanwhile , on the issues front , I’ve been fascinated by how much Republicans have come to love contraception . Really , if they get any more enthusiastic they’re going to start passing out condoms at the debates .David : Or wearing them on their heads like Howie Mandel .Gail : I’ve heard several Republican Senate candidates announce that they wanted to see birth control pills sold over the counter . This usually starts with a question about Obamacare – and the requirement that employers cover contraceptives in their health insurance plans . Then the Republican says that if birth control pills were sold like aspirin or Tums , they’d be much cheaper . Which may be true , although having them paid for by your insurance is certainly a better deal .David : That’s clearly true . I’m struck , though , by how much the Democrats’ war-on-women charge against the G.O.P . doesn’t seem to be working . In the last Times poll , women were split down the middle , supporting Republicans almost as much as Democrats , 42-43 .Gail : They were still more Democratic-leaning than men . And I do think it’s working in some races , particularly the ones where the Republican candidate supported the personhood amendment . You know , the one that declares all fertilized eggs have the full rights of a human being .That came up in the Iowa Senate debate , which I am slightly embarrassed to admit I watched from beginning to end .David : Wow . You do have swing state envy . Are you listening to reports on corn prices too ?Gail : Iowa debates are always worthwhile . I enjoy the moment when the fiscal conservative calls for less federal spending , and then is forced to make it clear that underwriting the manufacture of corn-based ethanol does not count as wasteful .David : My problem with the ethanol subsidies is purely selfish . You used to be able to drive around Iowa and see some crop diversity . Now it’s corn , corn , corn . I bet that even the field of dreams is covered with corn . It’s tedious .Gail : There’s been a growing attempt on the part of Republicans to bring ISIS into the campaign . Most of the ads I’ve seen don’t have a coherent theme . It’s like , “When terrorists were beheading Americans in Syria , Senator X supported the Obama administration and also missed a public hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee.”David : I’m just glad to see any foreign policy in this election . We should have at least some form of national debate on ISIS . I guess this is also a Republican effort to nationalize the election . As observers like Sean Trende have noted , earlier in the campaign there was a disjunction between the fundamentals and the polls . The fundamentals — the president’s low approval ratings — suggest this should be a big Republican year . But the polls were much closer . Many Democratic candidates were hanging in there , even in states Romney carried . Over the past month the polls have moved slightly toward the fundamentals — that is in a slightly Republican direction .Gail : People are so angry at Barack Obama . Their ire seems to be mainly about the economy , yet compared to many other countries , the United States is doing pretty well economically . I’m happy to accept the theory that people are angry because of income inequality and the struggling middle class . But the solution to that wouldn’t be electing a Congress that’s determined to cut federal spending . You’d just wind up with more laid-off state employees , highway construction workers , even schoolteachers .Want to explain that to me ?David : It’s possible that people don’t think they’re getting their money’s worth . It could be they’re not crazy about boondoggles like ethanol or gubernatorial trips to Afghanistan . It’s possible that they think they could spend money more wisely than Congress does . Can’t imagine how they could leap to that conclusion .Gail : Well , that’s Congress . But they’re trying to make it all about the president . I’m expecting that Georgia voters will soon be seeing ads in which Michelle Nunn’s picture morphs into Barack Obama .David : What strikes me about this is that the movement is similar across many races , suggesting that there is a national dynamic in place . That makes sense . Over the past five midterms we’ve pretty much seen national dynamics in place most of the time . There was a wave for one party or another . This year that should favor Republicans , who are trying to build the election around national issues , not local candidates .Gail : Do you think these elections matter ? There’s a lot of sentiment that they don’t – that if the Republicans take over the Senate , there’ll be the same stalemate we’ve got now . That it might even make it easier for the Democrats in 2016 , because there’ll still be gridlock and the Republicans will be more clearly to blame .David : I’m simple-minded . I think winning is better than losing . Remember , once an incumbent gets in , he or she is likely to stay there for a long time . I don’t think Democrats should be pre-rationalizing this year’s results .Gail : Me neither . Although it would be pretty interesting if the Republicans won control of the Senate , and we got to spend two years watching them complain about the evils of the filibuster .David : I can’t imagine much legislation will be passed either way . After Obamacare , which was signed into law in March of 2010 , I can’t think of a major piece of legislation that has passed in any of the last four years , and I suppose we’ll go another two in the same stagnation .Gail : You must be forgetting the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act .But about these elections – I admit that I am jealous of the big swing states . If I was in Iowa or Alaska or North Carolina , I’d be obsessed with the senate race . I’d talk about it all the time , and people would run away when they saw me coming .David : You’ve got it bad .Gail : Here in New York , everything’s pretty much preordained . Except in Staten Island , where the Republican congressman who threatened to throw a TV reporter over a Capitol balcony might be in trouble .David : Is that because TV reporters are so light ? Throwing a print reporter would be way more impressive .Gail : Well , he failed to follow through . Maybe his constituents are irked that he was all show and no throw . But he’s also under multiple indictments for perjury and tax evasion . And yet his defeat is not a foregone conclusion .David : I’d think a perjury record would be a plus . Practice makes perfect .
Over at Talking Points Memo , they seem bemused by the violent reaction on the right to any suggestion that Obamacare is working as well as all the evidence suggests it is . Josh Marshall and Ezra Klein both made a fairly obvious point : Kathleen Sebelius’s resignation was almost surely timed to follow good news , so that her departure wouldn’t be easy to spin as part of a narrative about failed reform . The right , however , went ballistic — not so much expressing skepticism over the good enrollment numbers and the encouraging survey data as expressing total outrage and bewilderment that anyone believes the good news . On the right they know , just know , that it’s a total disaster .What’s interesting about this is that conservative health wonks , however much they may like to spin facts , know better : even on the right , everyone who knows anything about the subject has been telling people not to expect a collapse , a death spiral , whatever , and even suggesting that Republicans may need to accept that much of Obamacare is irreversible . But not many people in that camp read , say , Avik Roy ; they’re getting their information from Fox News and Rush , and they hear nothing but tales of disaster .But why would they place so much faith in these sources ? These are , after all , the same sources that told them that Romney was going to win big , that we were headed for hyperinflation , and much much more . How can such experiences not have instilled at least a bit of doubt ?Well , we basically know the answer . One thing I learned from reporting on the Madoff affair was the term “affinity fraud” : people are easily duped by con men who seem to be like them , to be their kind of people . What Fox , Rush etc . do is build a cultural and emotional bond with their audiences , based mainly on who they dislike and attack . And that bond induces those audiences to believe that what comes from these sources is the obvious truth , never mind what those arrogant elitists with their “facts” and “data” may be saying . ( I’m turning into Stephen Colbert as we speak . )Anyway , it’s quite a sight to behold .
Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I don’t want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesn’t wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But it’s also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . It’s just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that it’s indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , it’s entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate you’ll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . That’s why you keep seeing Obamacare’s defenders argue that the law’s income effect — where people work less because they’re getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost — is mostly fine , because we don’t want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And it’s why , when they talk about the substitution effect — the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job — they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacare’s existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal … in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .What’s being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative — a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage — to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think it’s a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare … because even granted the pro-redistribution premise it’s still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work — the earned income tax credit is the notable example — and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But there’s no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new “health care” share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isn’t delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or — to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea — new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I don’t want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesn’t do . I’ll just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the woman’s health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Here’s the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine — R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment — and what the government spends for us — does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that don’t seem to be producing the promised results .
Sorry about blog silence — real life intruded , plus I did have to write a column . But I shouldn’t let the day pass without mentioning the latest big Obamacare news . Final enrollment for 2014 , we now know , will be more than 8 million . The age mix has also improved , with more young people signing up at the end ; as Jonathan Cohn points out in the linked article , the age mix in Obamacare’s first year is now just about identical to the age mix in Romneycare’s first year . Goodbye , death spiral .How did enrollment manage to surge so impressively despite the initial debacle of healthcare.gov ? Obviously they fixed the website ; but the broader issue , as Sarah Kliff rightly points out , is that being uninsured is truly terrible . Uninsured Americans really , really wanted coverage , and they weren’t ready to give up .Kliff doesn’t make this point too explicitly , but this diagnosis has another crucial implication : the benefits of Obamacare , for all its imperfections , are immense . Millions of people who lived extremely anxious lives now have far more security than before . Compared with those benefits , the complaints of some already insured people that they have less choice of doctors than before , or that they’re no longer allowed to retain minimalist plans , look like whining . ( And of course not one of the more serious-sounding stories about soaring premiums and all that has held up under scrutiny . )And speaking of whining , the GOP response seems to be to make every possible insinuation to the effect that the numbers are somehow fraudulent . I actually don’t think there’s a game plan here ; their whole position was premised on the inevitable collapse of health reform , and they have no plan B .All around , as Cohn says , a very good day for reform .
Noah Smith writes that one should not be rude about people you disagree with , because they might turn out to be right . Indeed ; what possible purpose can be served by , say , referring to Austrian economics as a brain worm ? Oh , wait .Actually , I think that Noah was doing the right thing when he brought in the brain worms , and is off on the wrong track on the civility thing . So let me make the case for brain worms .First , picturesque language , used right , serves an important purpose . “Words ought to be a little wild , ” wrote John Maynard Keynes , “for they are the assaults of thoughts on the unthinking.” You could say , “I’m dubious about the case for expansionary austerity , which rests on questionable empirical evidence and zzzzzzzz…” ; or you could accuse austerians of believing in the Confidence Fairy . Which do you think is more effective at challenging a really bad economic doctrine ?Beyond that , civility is a gesture of respect — and sure enough , the loudest demands for civility come from those who have done nothing to earn that respect . Noah felt ( and was ) justified in ridiculing the Austrians because they don’t argue in good faith ; faced with a devastating failure of their prediction about inflation , they didn’t concede that they were wrong and try to explain why . Instead , they denied reality or tried to redefine the meaning of inflation .And if you look at the uncivil remarks by people like , well , me , you’ll find that they are similarly aimed at people arguing in bad faith . I talk now and then about zombie and cockroach ideas . Zombies are ideas that should have been killed by evidence , but keep shambling along — e.g . the claim that all of Europe’s troubled debtors were fiscally irresponsible before the crisis ; cockroaches are ideas that you thought we’d gotten rid of , but keep on coming back , like the claim that Keynes would never have called for fiscal stimulus in the face of current debt levels ( Britain in the 1930s had much higher debt to GDP than it does now ) . Well , what I’m doing is going after bad-faith economics — economics that keeps trotting out claims that have already been discredited .Nor are zombies and cockroaches the only kinds of bad faith ; the worst , as far as I’m concerned , involves refusing to take responsibility for your actual statements . “The failure of high inflation to materialize doesn’t mean that I was wrong , because I only said that there was a risk of inflation” . “When I said that Obamacare spending adds a trillion dollars to the deficit , I wasn’t misleading readers , because I didn’t actually deny that the ACA as a whole reduces the deficit.” And of course , people who engage in that kind of bad faith screech loudly about civility when they’re caught at it .When there’s an honest , good-faith economic debate — say , the ongoing controversy about the effects of quantitative easing — by all means let’s be civil . But in my experience demands for civility almost always come from people who have forfeited the right to the respect they demand .
The good news about Obamacare so far shouldn’t be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what I’m getting — and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK — is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that it’s not a disaster .What’s that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster he’s been — when the column didn’t so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now they’re livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters — don’t bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , there’s now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks don’t deceive .

Jonathan Cohn looks at the evidence so far on health insurance premiums , and finds things not too bad:Coverage will get more expensive for the majority of consumers , as it almost always does . Changes in premiums will vary enormously , from state to state and from plan to plan . But , overall , the 2015 premiums increases will not be significantly worse than they were in the past . They might even be a little better .Charles Gaba finds much the same . Furthermore , there’s a clear trend within the trend : states that did their best to make Obamacare work are also delivering good deals to their residents . California is heading for an increase of only 4.2 percent . On the other hand , things are not looking too good in Florida:In Florida , by contrast , the Republicans in charge did very little to promote the law and , at times , seemed determined to undermine it . Never was this more clear than in 2013 , when the legislature passed and Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that suspended state government’s ability to reject excessive premium increases .Overall , yet more evidence that this reform works wherever politicians let it work .
Three somehow related stories of the day:1 . Brent Bozell’s Media Research Center is an important part of the machinery that has , for the most part , successfully intimidated the news media into adopting a right-wing slant . ( I’ve faced mass mailings , concerted attacks on my university email , and so on . ) But Jim Romenesko finds something interesting : Bozell doesn’t write his own columns or books , forcing a staffer to do it .2 . The Koch brothers have been running ads in Louisiana with distressed citizens facing ruination from Obamacare . But the people in the ads are all paid actors .3 . Best of all is the news from The Can Kicks Back , which is a Bowles-Simpson-run outfit that was supposed to be the youth arm of Fix the Debt . It has always been an astroturf operation , and a clumsy one at that , doing things like hiring dancers to stage fake flash mobs and placing identical ghostwritten articles in college newspapers . Now , The Can Kicks Back’s campaign against debt is running into trouble , because it’s , um , running out of money .What these stories have in common is that they show how much of what passes for genuine expression of public concern is really just a bought and paid-for ( or , in the case of The Can , not sufficiently paid-for ) front for plutocratic priorities .
The Iowa Senate candidate who charmed the Internet recently with her hog-castration ad—a disturbing metaphor for her claim that she would “cut pork” in Washington—has joined the distinguished club of political aspirants who shoot things they don’t like , on camera .Here’s Joni Ernst at a firing range , taking “aim at wasteful spending” and setting her “sights on Obamacare.”Before Ms. Ernst brought a gun to a political fight , Ron Gould , an Arizona State Senator who ran for Congress in 2012—but didn’t get past the Republican primaries—blew away a copy of the Affordable Care Act .Before that , a man and a young girl in a Herman Cain ad hurled a rabbit out of a catapult and shot it . The rabbit represented the tax code .And before that , Joe Manchin , now the junior senator from West Virginia , killed a cap-and-trade bill .Mr. Manchin won his race . Mr. Cain and Mr. Gould lost theirs . If Ms. Ernst succeeds , she’ll even out the odds for armed politicians in years to come .
The Commonwealth Fund is out with a new report comparing advanced-country health care systems , and the ( mostly pre-Obamacare ) US system looks very bad indeed : vastly higher spending per capita than anyone else , with worse results .Of course , this is nothing new . And as always pointing out the obvious brings out claims that the US system is somehow superior despite its lousy outcomes . Aaron Carroll helpfully reminds us that all of the arguments surfacing here are zombies – arguments that should have died in the face of clear evidence that they’re wrong , but keep on shambling along nonetheless . ( I actually learned the term “zombie idea” from the health care discussion , specifically the unending attempts to trash the Canadian system . )I think it’s important , however , to be explicit about something Carroll obviously knows but doesn’t emphasize : the reason for the prevalence of zombies in this field . Some of it is chauvinism . But the main reason for the zombies is unwillingness to accept facts that conflict with ideology . The American health care system is by far the most privatized , most market-oriented system in the advanced world ; it’s also far and away the most expensive , without any sign of getting anything for all that money .If you are committed to the view that the magic of the market solves all problems , this is disturbing – so it must not be true . Bring on the zombies !
“They call me a long shot , ” Estakio Beltran , a congressional candidate in Washington state , declares in a TV ad , never once disclosing that he’s a Democrat but taking aim with his shotgun at a piñata — an elephant piñata in case anyone doubts what he’s gunning for . Bam ! the gun goes off and the sad-eyed , paper-tattered toy elephant topples . Mr. Beltran’s ad is one of many bamming and kerpowing across the land from candidates pandering to gun enthusiasts . He may not win an election , but his seems the most entertaining or at least the silliest . Particularly so when he racks the empty shell from his gun in macho triumph and rides off like Clint Eastwood , heading east toward the Capitol on a loping donkey ( a Democratic donkey ? ) .Gun ads come and go as political staccato punctuating the electioneering season . They play out as an entirely separate reality from such familiar Americana as the accidental Uzi death last week at the hands of a nine-year-old in Arizona . The latest ads were collected by National Public Radio and , unsurprisingly , shooting a thick wad of “Obamacare” legislation is the cliché of choice among Republicans bearing arms . Will Brooke , a Republican congressional candidate in Alabama , has “a little fun , ” showing off his considerable arsenal of favored weapons — everything from gleaming pistol to ominous assault rifle — and shooting them all at what the Supreme Court has pronounced the law of the land . Joni Ernst , a leather-clad Republican running for Senate from Iowa , dismounts her motorcycle and gets off six rounds and a promise to “unload” on the Affordable Care Act . “Give me a shot ! ” she implores voters in her sign-off .So it goes , to the point where Republicans choosing other sorts of targets provide merciful relief . Matt Rosendale , a Montana candidate for the House , blasts up and away at what he would have you believe is a federal drone snooping on his sacred freedoms . Dan Sullivan , an Alaska Republican running for the Senate , drills a defenseless old TV set , standing his ground against out-of-staters flooding the airwaves with mudslinging campaign ads .So far , no one is making a commercial about the new Idaho law that allows teachers and students to bring guns to class . A professor exercising his “enhanced concealed carry” rights at the state university in Pocatello accidentally shot himself in the foot Wednesday .But in truth , there are moments of substance in the politics of the gun . The ballot in Washington state has competing gun initiatives this fall , with rival check writers going at it to finance TV commercials . Initiative 594 aims to close the notorious loophole that lets people buy guns without background checks online and at gun shows . Backing it are such major donors as Bill and Melinda Gates and Nick Hanauer , the Seattle venture capitalist . In contrast , initiative 591 would prevent the expansion of background checks . The gun lobby stands behind this as the ballot duel plays out .
One of the truly amazing ( and disheartening ) things about the Great Recession and its aftermath has been the continuing insistence of many economists that it’s somehow a supply-side slump , driven by the evils of Obamacare or something . This tends to come from people who view stagflation in the 1970s as having permanently refuted all things Keynes .So I guess it’s worth pointing out repeatedly that the recent slump shows all the hallmarks of a demand-side shock ; in particular , rising unemployment has been associated with falling inflation — the opposite of stagflation . Here’s an international comparison I happen to have produced for other purposes , comparing the change in unemployment from 2007 to 2013 with the change in inflation over the same period:An interesting point : if you fit a linear equation to these points , the slope of the implied Phillips curve is -0.16 — which is the same number the influential recent paper by Kiley ( pdf ) finds using combined time series and cross-section on US metropolitan areas . Just a coincidence , probably , but I had expected the international relationship to look weaker .

A large majority of Americans say they like the insurance coverage they obtained through government exchanges , which were set up by the Affordable Care Act .Via PoliticoWith the second round of Obamacare enrollment set to begin on Saturday , 71 percent said their coverage through the exchanges was good or excellent , according to a Gallup poll released Friday . Another 19 percent said the coverage was fair , while 9 percent rated it poorly .The pollster notes that these marks are comparable to all who have health insurance . However , those newly insured through the exchanges are more satisfied with the cost of health care — with 75 percent saying so — versus 61 percent of all insured respondents who said they were satisfied with the cost of health care .
Ezra Klein directs us to the latest from the Kaiser Family Foundation , which asks what the average Obamacare 2015 premium increase will be for those places for which we have full information — and finds that premiums will actually decline slightly . Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment:Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress , who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare’s cost , that the law would be cheaper than predicted and , at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars , cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought . After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security , let’s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet . What odds do you think Obamacare’s critics would have offered ? 2:1 ? 5:1 ? 10:1 ?But you don’t have to go back to 2010 . Look at John Cochrane in late 2013 , taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months . Look at The Hill just four months ago , telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming .One question we might ask here is , why is the news so good ? The answer , I’d suggest — although I hope the real experts will weigh in — is that we’re actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral ; call it a life spiral . For one thing , the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected , and they now expect 2015 to be better still . Also , importantly , big enrollments mean that more insurers are entering the market , increasing competition . And , of course , the better the deal the more people will sign up : success feeds success .Another question we might ask : Is our conservatives learning ? Are those who bought into the death spiral stories , who seized on every hint of bad news , asking themselves how they got it so wrong ? Are they , maybe , considering the possibility that they’re listening to the wrong people , that maybe Jon Gruber knows what he’s talking about and John Goodman is a hack ?Hahahaha .
SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat — potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states — currently 14 — that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case “en banc” on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through “an Exchange” that is “established by a State” means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help — in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges — two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent — and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable .
On Thursday morning , as almost everyone predicted it would , the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. , voted to toss out a three-judge panel’s ruling upholding the latest attempt to kill “Obamacare.” The full 11-member court is scheduled to rehear the case on Dec. 17 .The claim this time was that subsidies for the health exchanges that are at the heart of the law are available only to those exchanges “established by the State.” In other words , not available in the three dozen states where the federal government has set up an exchange because the state refused to . This would result in the denial of coverage to an estimated 4.7 million Americans . To succeed , the claim required that those four words be considered in a hermetically sealed tube , independent from the rest of the 900-page law , whose core purpose was to ensure affordable health-care to lower-income Americans .Luckily for the challengers , two of the three panel judges in the case , Halbig v. Burwell , were sympathetic to that way of reading the law . The third was less impressed , calling it a “not-so-veiled attempt to gut” the Affordable Care Act .The rehearing will occur before a court with a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents . For that reason , many predict that the court will side with the government and reject the challengers’ claim .This matters because the challengers desperately wanted to pole-vault over the D.C. appeals court and go straight to the Supreme Court — where they believe they have their best shot at winning once and for all . It’s the high-stakes version of what lawyers call “forum-shopping” — each side maneuvering to get a case into the court where they feel their chances are best .While it’s generally wise to avoid gaming out judges’ votes based simply on the party of their appointing president , in the Halbig case , that has been a reliable proxy .Of course , a key reason for the current makeup of the D.C. appeals court is the Senate’s reform of the filibuster process last fall , which was triggered by Republicans’ refusal to allow a vote on any of President Obama’s three nominees to that court . After the reform , all three nominees were confirmed .If anyone was wondering what the hue and cry over filibuster reform was really about in practice , the Halbig case is Exhibit A .
It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term “Obamacare.” So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , it’s fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races “are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act.” Here’s the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course haven’t embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that it’s actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that it’s not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls .
In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacare’s claim to be a policy success , I didn’t directly address the law’s eventual impact on the deficit . So I’m grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the law’s promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryan’s words ) on “gimmicks and smoke and mirrors , ” Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the law’s coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the right’s inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Office’s update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the right’s certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : It’s focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesn’t address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that “CBO … can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues … isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.”So the report doesn’t tell us anything , and doesn’t claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they aren’t ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or … well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isn’t proof that the law is “even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast , ” because that simply isn’t a question it sets out to answer .This doesn’t mean , though , that we can’t make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that what’s happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions — delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPAB’s mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didn’t include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success … because it’s entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable — but it’s not clear , given the law’s coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way that’s much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the law’s architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point we’ll actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors — but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that can’t necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.’s point about the difficulty of “isolating” the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that it’s entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on America’s fiscal picture overall — because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers’ options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of “double counting” and “gimmickry” and the like — they’re saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , you’re engaged in something other than “fiscal conservatism , ” because you haven’t actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe — hopefully — a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But it’s quite possible that we’ll end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that it’s created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point .
No , I haven’t lost my mind — or suddenly become an Ayn Rand disciple . It’s not my ideal ; in a better world I’d call for single-payer , and a significant role for the government in directly providing care .But Ross Douthat , in the course of realistically warning his fellow conservatives that Obamacare doesn’t seem to be collapsing , goes on to tell them that they’re going to have to come up with a serious alternative .But Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , and not just because it was originally devised at the Heritage Foundation . It’s what a health-care system that does what even conservatives say they want , like making sure that people with preexisting conditions can get coverage , has to look like if it isn’t single-payer .I don’t really think one more repetition of the logic will convince many people , but here we go again . Suppose you want preexisting conditions covered . Then you have to impose community rating — insurers must offer the same policies to people regardless of medical history . But just doing that causes a death spiral , because people wait until they’re sick to buy insurance . So you also have to have a mandate , requiring healthy people to join the risk pool . And to make buying insurance possible for people with lower incomes , you have to have subsidies .And what you’ve just defined are the essentials of ObamaRomneyCare . It’s a three-legged stool that needs all three legs . If you want to cover preexisting conditions , you must have the mandate ; if you want the mandate , you must have subsidies . If you think there’s some magic market-based solution that obviates the stuff conservatives don’t like while preserving the stuff they like , you’re deluding yourself .What this means in practice is that any notion that Republicans will go beyond trying to sabotage the law and come up with an alternative is fantasy . Again , Obamacare is the conservative alternative , and you can’t move further right without doing no reform at all .
So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is “a failure on a number of levels” . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But it’s not just misinformation ; the reality doesn’t matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed .
One of the odd rituals of American punditry — the most famous example is Karl Rove’s tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time — is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and let’s dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , what’s the point ? The votes are already in ; you can’t build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldn’t election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know that’s what the base believes , because it’s what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not — if famous senators don’t have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But that’s really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , there’s not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even that’s doubtful — by the fall , we’re going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the — to use the technical term — wussiness of it all . Isn’t there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that it’s not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes .
Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . They’ve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasn’t such a good idea — in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But it’s really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that they’re against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of “cooking the books” to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why don’t they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?
If you’ve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act – which is easy thanks to Charles Gaba’s invaluable site – you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , it’s official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But here’s the thing : every online article I’ve seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isn’t true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium – ahem , 47 percent of the total – will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You can’t help but notice the resemblance to the “unskewing” fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I don’t know that for sure – but it’s very unlikely that they’re right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers – people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO – which has a reputation to defend – thinks it’s going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldn’t be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that it’s not going to happen is furious denial .
Here and here and here .A sample:Well , I suppose some of the people who predicted doom will reconsider their views , and engage in some soul-searching about why they were so wrong — maybe even realize that they were letting their politics distort their analysis .You can stop laughing now .
The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the law’s supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured:… The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents’ plans . There’s been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates I’ve seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and you’re close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . That’s what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , it’s insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says “in the same ballpark , ” he means “in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected.” That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right we’re probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( I’m relying on “best estimates” for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohn’s ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower … you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesn’t really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped — making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so — or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers — the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs — that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent “what count as success” list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think it’s entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the law’s supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what we’re seeing at the moment — even if there’s still a long , long way to go .
Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups — an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative — namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we don’t yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we don’t know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we don’t know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and won’t for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , they’ll spend months listening to “unskewers” claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and can’t replace it , etc , etc.. There really isn’t any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work .
Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacare’s repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare state’s ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacare’s critics as well . What isn’t killed outright grows stronger the longer it’s embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesn’t work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes — it’s possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But it’s still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that “possible , ” and change the “likely” to an “all-but-definite.” Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We don’t know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We don’t know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We don’t know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly don’t know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there won’t be an immediate political unraveling , and that we aren’t headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bill’s architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the law’s opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive .
WashingtonIF Mitt Romney’s pivots on President’s Obama’s health care reform act have accelerated to a blur — from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states — it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan’s passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , “government takeover of health care.” It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system — principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The president’s program extends the current health care system — mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals — by removing the biggest obstacles to that system’s functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability — yes , another conservative idea . Under today’s system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals’ coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans — with their own money on an exchange — first floated around Washington , advocates called them “association health plans.” They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration’s reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of “Hillarycare” in the mid-’90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform — essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romney’s argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states’ rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare .
WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing , by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues — the famous “third rails” of American politics — none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obama’s estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palin’s rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obama’s , it holds limited promise for containing the program’s escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .That’s where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryan’s approach was rendered toothless when the issue’s brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular “waste , fraud and abuse” ) .If the cap was breached — as it almost certainly would eventually be — Mr. Ryan blithely says , “Congress would be required to intervene.” Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obama’s hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obama’s credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan’s ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board can’t propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .That’s the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : “Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.”To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews can’t be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Let’s not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan’s competition or Mr. Obama’s innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the program’s budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , it’s natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled — including Canada , Australia and New Zealand — have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatment’s ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable .
Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .…The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 .
The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the law’s coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , it’s likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .It’s actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesn’t appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBO’s primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges — what the administration calls “marketplaces”— are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be .
The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , “substantial shares” of the uninsured population don’t realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .“As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the law’s subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half don’t know about the law’s expansion of Medicaid.”
The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If you’ve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .It’s easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasn’t even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly — they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers weren’t allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they don’t know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administration’s lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you weren’t reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 …
LOS ANGELES â THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Iâd be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonâs long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyâs â I paraphrase â draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would âbe actually much richer.âI , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .âObamacare or Kafkacare ? â I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Iâm a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the âlike.â Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyâd commiserate .Except that they didnât .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , âMy dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because itâs free , â my respondents implied â in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more âlikesâ â that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .âThe nation has been better off , â wrote one friend . âOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.â Thatâs all fine and good for âthe nation , â but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , âYes , Iâm paying an extra 200 a month , but Iâm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.âI was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyâs well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnât affect people directly , they became âtheoretically generous.â Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance â which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do â and Iâll bet theyâd change their tune about âending inequalityâ and âcreating fairnessâ and âdoing whatâs good for the country.âRefreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnât have to pay for everyone elseâs pregnancies . Little did I know Iâd end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elseâs pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , âBut , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! âLike Bridget Jonesâs âsmug marrieds , â the âsmug insuredsâ â friends who were covered through their own or spousesâ employers or who were grandfathered into their plans â asked why I didnât âjustâ switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Iâm dating . How romantic : âI didnât marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.âAlong with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnât care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itâs for the good of the country , a vast improvement âover all.âAnd the âover allâ might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because itâs trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well â as long as yours isnât the âfortunateâ family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single âlike.â Itâs the lone âlikeâ that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear .
FRANKFORT , Ky. â SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky â more quickly than almost any other state â moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because thereâs a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Itâs no coincidence that numerous governors â not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan â see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residentsâ collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Weâre making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thatâs almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they donât get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctorâs appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger â jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckyâs uninsured â mostly the working poor â will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckyâs economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnât afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage â most with a discount â through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckyâs Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we canât implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Iâm offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Itâs shameful that these critics havenât invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work â when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckyâs families , I say , âGet over it.âThe Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life .
Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads they’ve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture — they’re suffering !OK , we’ve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking American’s brave fighting men and women ?But there’s a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters — a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he can’t possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it can’t be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then it’s worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So here’s what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isn’t magic — it produces losers as well as winners . But it’s not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people — the healthy and wealthy — to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , it’s almost certainly not true — people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they can’t be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers — people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories — the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false — because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen .
Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isn’t actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect .
You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youâd be wrong .After Paul Ryanâs fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that stateâs Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlerâs mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnât need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that heâs been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senateâs prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program canât be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyâre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Itâs not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankersâ bonuses were intended âto get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses.â This , he added , was âsort of like what we did in the Deep South.âHow absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Weâre awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and itâs impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Thereâs seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it canât be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianaâs Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that dayâs horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring â-gateâ mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixonâs crimes , we dilute them . Itâs just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintonâs private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.âs scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I canât even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnât matter . Itâs to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothingâs distinctive . Itâs all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , weâd be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : âBoehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage.â That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamaâs agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whatâs just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Weâre in an unfortunate place , but we neednât travel back there to describe it .
Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator who’s running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a “disaster.” Then he was asked what he’s for — and he went on to describe Obamacare . “I’ve always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee , ” he said . “That’s all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do.” He even said it could “include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.”Oh , he also promises his plan won’t raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare .
Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts — here , and then here — defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , “won , ” and that conservatives who can’t come to terms with that victory can’t come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track , ” and concludes that “ [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success , ” it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing , isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the law’s supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible — and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.’s more modest projection for this year .So … how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.’s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesn’t ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , it’s only fallen by , say , 15 million instead — and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably there’s some kind of shortfall that the law’s supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the law’s supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating “that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.”Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this year’s roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the law’s supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacare’s impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed — so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words — what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . It’s been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver — with writers like Klein famously invoking “lives saved” figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the law’s passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , I’m curious what liberals expect to see , what they’ll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , I’ll lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflation’s five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled “I Was Wrong About Obamacare” — or , if he prefers , just “Ezra Klein Was Right.”
TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the president’s enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the president’s Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics “expose” the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , they’re actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romney’s car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure they’ll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the “affordable” part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet — I would be remiss if I didn’t say this — Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughter’s spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she won’t be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Let’s not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year — money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients’ health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermont’s plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . That’s why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators who’ll go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So let’s get started . Obamacare can’t be fixed by its namesake . It’s up to us to make it happen .
A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling stands—a big if—it could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didn’t qualify for tax credits after all .
The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : It’s going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true .
